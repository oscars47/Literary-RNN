The Sufis are an ancient spiritual freemasonry whose ori¬ 
gins have never been traced or dated; nor do they themselves 
take much interest in such researches, being content to point 
out the occurrence of their own way of thought in different 
regions and periods. Though commonly mistaken for a Mos¬ 
lem sect, the Sufis are at home in all religions: just as the 
“Free and Accepted Masons” lay before them in their Lodge 
whatever sacred book—whether Bible, Koran, or Torah—is 
accepted by the temporal State. If they call Islam the 
“shell” of Sufism, this is because they believe Sufism to be 
the secret teaching within all religions. Yet according to Ali 
el-Hujwiri, an early authoritative Sufi writer, the Prophet 
Mohammed himself said: “He who hears the voice of the 
Sufi people and does not say aamin [Amen] is recorded 
in God's presence as one of the heedless.” Numerous other 
traditions link him with the Sufis, and it was in Sufi style 
that he ordered his followers to respect all People of a Book, 
meaning those who respected their own sacred scriptures— 
a term later taken to include Zoroastrians. 

Nor are the Sufis a sect, being bound by no religious 
dogma however tenuous and using no regular place of wor¬ 
ship. They have no sacred city, no monastic organization, 
no religious instruments. They even dislike being given any 
inclusive name which might force them into doctrinal con¬ 
formity. “Sufi” is no more than a nickname, like “Quaker,” 
which they accept good-humoredly. “We friends” or “people 
like us” is how they refer to themselves, and they recognize 


vni 


THE SUFIS 


one another by certain natural gifts, habits, qualities of 
thought Sufi schools have indeed gathered around particu¬ 
lar teachers, but there is no graduation and they exist only 
for the convenience of those who work to perfect their 
studies by close association with fellow Sufis. The charac¬ 
teristic Sufic signature is found in widely dispersed liter¬ 
ature from at least the second millennium B.C., and al¬ 
though their most obvious impact on civilization was made 
between the eighth and eighteenth centuries A.D., Sufis 
are still active as ever. They number some fifty million. 
What makes them so difficult to discuss is that their mutual 
recognition cannot be explained in ordinary moral or psy¬ 
chological terms—whoever understands it is himself a Sufi. 
Though awareness of this secret quality or instinct can be 
sharpened by close contact with Sufis of experience, there 
are no hierarchical degrees among them, only a general un¬ 
disputed recognition of greater or lesser capacity. 

Sufism has gained an Oriental flavor from having been 
so long protected by Islam, but the natural Sufi may be as 
common in the West as in the East, and may come dressed 
as a general, a peasant, a merchant, a lawyer, a schoolmaster, 
a housewife, anything. To be “in the world, but not of it," 
free from ambition, greed, intellectual pride, blind obedience 
to custom, or awe of persons higher in rank—that is the 
Sufi's ideal. 

Sufis respect the rituals of religion insofar as these further 
social harmony, but broaden religion's doctrinal basis 
wherever possible and define its myths in a higher sense— 
for instance, explaining angels as representations of man's 
higher faculties. The individual devotee is offered a “secret 
garden" for the growth of his understanding, but never re¬ 
quired to become a monk, nun or hermit, like the more con¬ 
ventional mystics; and he thereafter claims to be enlightened 
by actual experience—’'Tie who tastes, knows"—not by phil¬ 
osophic argument. The earliest known theory of conscious 
evolution is of Sufi origin but, though much quoted by 



INTRODUCTION

Darwinians in the great nineteenth-century controversy, it 
applies to the individual rather than to the race. The child’s 
slow progress into manhood or womanhood figures as only a 
stage in his development of more spectacular powers for 
which the dynamic force is love, not either asceticism or the 
intellect 

Enlightenment comes with love—love in the poetic sense 
of perfect devotion to a Muse who, whatever apparent 
cruelties she may commit or however seemingly irrational 
her behavior, knows what she is doing. She seldom rewards 
her poet with any express sign of her favor, but confirms his 
devotion by its revivifying effect on him. Thus Ibn El-Arabi 
(1165-1240), a Spanish Arab from Murcia whom the Sufis 
call their Master Poet, wrote in his Tarjuman el-Ashwaq 
(Interpreter of Desires): 

If I bow to her as is my duty 

And if she never returns my salutation 

Have I just cause for complaint? 

Lovely woman feel no obligation. 

This love theme was later used in an ecstatic cult of the 
Virgin Mary, who until the Crusades had occupied an un¬ 
important position in the Christian religion. Her greatest 
veneration today is precisely in those parts of Europe that 
fell strongly under Sufic influence. 

Ibn El-Arabi says of himself: 

I follow the religion of Love. 

Now I am sometimes called 
A Shepherd of gazelles [divine wisdom] 

And now a Christian monk, 

And now a Persian sage. 

My beloved is Three- 
Three yet only one; 

Many things appear as three, 

Which are no more than one.

THE SUFIS 


Give her no name, 

As if to limit one 
At sight of whom 
All limitation is confounded* 

The poets were the chief disseminators of Sufi thought, 
earned the same reverence as did the ollamhs, or master 
poets, of early medieval Ireland, and used a similar secret 
language of metaphorical reference and verbal cipher* 
Nizami the Persian Sufi writes: “Under the poet’s tongue 
lies the key of the treasury.” This language was a protection 
both against the vulgarizing or institutionalizing of a habit 
of thought only proper to those that understand it, and 
against accusations of heresy or civil disobedience. Ibn El- 
Arabi, summoned before an Islamic inquisition at Aleppo 
to defend himself against charges of nonconformity, pleaded 
that his poems were metaphorical, the basic message being 
God’s perfection of man through divine love. He had, for 
precedent, the incorporation in the Jewish Scriptures of the 
erotic Song of Solomon, which was officially interpreted by 
the Pharisee sages as a metaphor of God’s love for Israel; 
and by the Catholic authorities as a metaphor of God’s love 
for his Church. 

In its most advanced form the secret language uses Semitic 
consonantal roots to conceal and reveal meanings; and 
Western scholars seem unaware that even the popular 
Thousand and One Nights is Sufic in content, land that its 
Arabic title Alf layla wa layla is a code phrase indicating its 
main content and intention: “Mother of Records.” Yet what 
seems at first sign Oriental occultism is an ancient and 
familiar Western habit of thought. Most English and 
French schoolchildren begin history lessons with I a picture of 
their Druidic ancestors lopping mistletoe from a| sacred oak. 
Although the Druids are credited by Caesar with ancestral 
mysteries and a secret language, the lopping seems so simple 
a ceremony, mistletoe being still used in Christmas decora-

tions, that few readers pause to consider what it means. The 
current view that the Druids were virtually emasculating 
the oak makes no sense. 

Now, all other sacred trees, plants and herbs have peculiar 
properties. The alder s timber is waterproof and its leaves 
yield a royal red dye; birch is the host of the hallucige- 
netic fly-cap mushroom; oak and ash attract lightning for a 
holy fire; the mandrake root is antispasmodic. The foxglove 
yields digitalis which accelerates the beat of the heart; pop¬ 
pies are opiates; ivy has toxic leaves and its flowers provide 
bees with the last honey of the year. But the berries of the 
mistletoe, widely known in folklore as an “allheal,” have 
no medicinal properties, though greedily eaten by wood 
pigeons and other nonmigratory birds in winter. The leaves 
are equally valueless; and the timber, though tough, can 
be put to few uses. Why then was the mistletoe singled out 
as the most sacred and curative of plants? The only answer 
can be that the Druids used it as an emblem of their own 
peculiar way of thought. Here is a tree that is no tree, 
but fastens itself alike on oak, apple, poplar, beech, thorn, 
even pine, grows green, nourishing itself on the topmost 
branches when the rest of the forest seems asleep, and the 
fruit of which is credited with curing all spiritual disorders. 
Lopped sprigs of it are tied to the lintel of a door and in¬ 
vite sudden and surprising kisses. The symbolism is exact, if 
we can equate Druidic with Sufic thought, which is not 
planted like a tree, as religions are planted, but self- 
engrafted on a tree already in existence; it keeps green 
though the tree itself is asleep, in the sense that religions go 
dead by formalism; and the main motive power of its 
growth is love, not ordinary animal passion or domestic 
affection but a sudden surprising recognition of love so 
rare and high that the heart seems to sprout wings. Strangely 
enough, the Burning Bush from which God appeared to 
Moses in the desert is now thought by Biblical scholars to

have been an acacia glorified by the red leaves of a heart - 
thus, the Eastern equivalent of mistletoe. 1 I 

The Irish Muse-goddess Bridget was threefpld like the 
Muse celebrated by Ibn El-Arabi; and not threefold 
merely in the sense of being at once maiden, nymph and 
crone, but in that of presiding over three spiritual realms— 
poetry, healing and handicraft. It need not greatly concern 
us whether this concept is native to Ireland, or whether it 
came from the East along with the complicated arabesques 
of medieval Irish illumination art and the curiously Persian 
or Arabian forms of ninth-century Irish poems. Certainly 
a well-known ninth-century Celtic cross is distinguished by 
bearing the Arabic formula Bismillah er-Rahman, er-Rahim 
(In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful) 
as proof that Sufism is consistent with both religions. 

It should perhaps matter more that all the noblest Islamic 
art and architecture is Sufic, and that healing, especially of 
psychosomatic disorders, is every day practiced!by Sufis to¬ 
day as a natural love duty, though not until they have 
studied for at least twelve years. The ollamhs were also 
healers and studied twelve years in their woodland schools. 
The Sufi physician must not accept any payment more valu¬ 
able than a handful of barley, nor impose his i)wn will on 
the patient, as most modem psychiatrists do; but having 
put him into deep hypnosis he must make him diagnose his 
own disorder and prescribe the cure. The physician then 
gives advice on how to prevent a recurrence of the symptoms, 
though the demand for a cure must come directly from the 
patient, not from his family or well-wishers. 2

In Winter the bare boughs that seem to sleep 
Work covertly, preparing for their Spring, j 
Though he did not mention the mistletoe, or any otner locanthus, 
here is the visible emblem of the secret process of thought to which 
his lines refer.

Community,” International Journal of Clinical and Experimental

INTRODUCTION 


xiii 


After their conquest by the Saracens beginning in the 
eighth century A.D., Spain and Sicily became centers of 
Moslem civilization renowned for religious austerity. The 
northern scholars who flocked there to buy Arabic works 
for translation into Latin did not however demand ortho¬ 
dox Islamic doctrine but only Sufi literature and occasional 
scientific treatises. The songs of the troubadors—the word 
is unconnected with trobar, “to find/' but represents the 
Arabic root TRB, meaning “lutanist”—are now authorita¬ 
tively established as of Saracen origin. Yet Professor 
Guillaume points out in T he Legacy of Islam that 
poetry, romances, music and dance, all Sufi specialties, were 
no more welcomed by the orthodox authorities of Islam 
than by Christian bishops. Arabic, in fact, although a car¬ 
rier both for the Moslem religion and for Sufi thought, 
remained independent of either. 

In 1229, the island of Majorca, where I have lived since 
1929, was captured by Bang James of Aragon from the Sar¬ 
acens, who had held it for five centuries. He thereupon 
chose as his emblem a bat, which still appears above the 
arms of Palma, our capital. This bat emblem had long 
puzzled me, and the local tradition that it stood for "vigi¬ 
lance" did not seem a sufficient explanation, because the bat, 
in Christian usage, is an ill-omened creature associated with 
witchcraft. But I remembered that James I stormed Palma 
with the help of the Knights Templars and of two or three 
dissident Moorish noblemen living elsewhere in the island; 
that the Knights Templars had educated James in le bon 
saber, or wisdom; and that during the Crusades, the Knights 
Templars were accused of collaboration with Saracen Sufis. 
It therefore occurred to me that “bat” might have another 
meaning in Arabic, and be a signal to James's local Moorish 
allies, presumably Sufis, of his schooling in their own 
wisdom. 

I wrote to Idries Shah Sayed, who replied: 

The Arabic for bat is KHuFFaaSH, from the three- 

consonant root KH-F-SH. A second meaning of this 


XIV 


THE SUFIS 


root is "to overthrow,” ruin, trample down, probably 
because bats haunt ruined buildings. James's emblem 
was thus a simple rebus proclaiming himself "the 
Conqueror” as in Spanish he was known as El Rey 
Jaime, el Conquistador . But this is not the whole story. 

In Sufi literature, especially the love poetry of Ibn El- 
Arabi of Murcia which was current throughout 
Spain, "ruin” stands for the mind ruined byj unregen¬ 
erate thought and awaiting reedification. 

The only other meaning of this root is "weak-eyes, see¬ 
ing only by night.” This can convey much more than to 
be “blind as a bat.” Sufis speak of the unregenerate as 
blind to true reality; but also of themselves as blind to 
things which are important to the unregenejrate. Like 
the bat, the Sufi is asleep to "things of the day”— 
the familiar struggle for existence which the ordinary 
man finds all-important—and vigilant while others are 
asleep. In other words, he keeps awake the spiritual 
attention dormant in others. That "mankind sleeps in 
a nightmare of unfulfillment” is a commonplace of Sufi 
literature. Your Palma tradition of “vigilance” as a 
meaning of “bat” need not therefore be discounted. 

Thus the palma emblem combines King James's overt 
boast that he has broken the power of the fanatical Mos¬ 
lems who ruled Majorca, with a covert use of metaphor re¬ 
assuring his allies that he is one of their fraternity. It may 
be questioned whether King James spoke Arabic fluently, 
but for most of his advisors it will have been their second 
language, if not their first. Moreover, many thousands of 
writers have made play with the associated meanings of 
Arabic roots, even in countries where the language itself 
is not spoken. Urdu and Persian poets, whose languages 
are Indo-European and not Semitic, treat the roots some¬ 
what as if they were algebraic formulae.

staufen, Holy Roman Emperor (i 194-1250) is on display at 
the WeltHche-Schatzkammer, Vienna* Idiies Shah Sayed 
has explained its symbolism to me: 

In the center stands a palm tree, containing the nine 
elements of the “magic square of fifteen," a compli¬ 
cated diagram attributed to Geber (Jabir) the Sufi and 
reverenced alike by the Latin alchemists and the Chin- 
nese Taoists. The palm tree (NaKHL) is chosen be¬ 
cause the triconsonantal root NKHL also means “a fine 
essence descending almost impalpably," such as the di¬ 
vine element hardka or “blessedness." Words from the 
same root include sifted flour and a gentle drizzle of 
rain. Since the palm is a holy tree associated with birth 
among the Arabs, its appearance on a coronation robe 
means “Source of Blessedness." Moreover, the word for 
“palm tree" is tariqat, which is the Sufi technical term 
for “Being on the Path"—that is to say, Sufism. On 
either side of the palm a tiger is shown dragging down 
a camel. NMR is the Arabic root for “tiger," and JML 
for “camel." Thus the NMR overcomes the JML. But 
NMR also stands for “woolen garment" and for “unim¬ 
paired honor;” and since “Sufi" can mean “clad in 
wool," and since unimpaired honor is, with love, one 
of the two main pillars of Sufism, “Sufi" can be sub¬ 
stituted for “tiger." Thus “The Sufi overcomes JML." 
JML, too, means not only “camel," but also “elegance." 
As an indication that both the tiger and the camel are 
human, they wear similar stripes, but the camel has 
fewer, meaning that unimpaired honor is not altogether 
inelegant. Thus: “Under this divine source of Sufic 
blessedness, the unimpaired honor of the Wool-clad 
overcomes mere elegance." 

That absorption with the theme of love leads to ecstasy, 
all Sufis know. But whereas Christian mystics regard 
ecstasy as a union with God, and therefore the height of 
religious attainment, Sufis admit its value.only if the de-

THE SUFIS 


votee can afterward return to the world and live in a man¬ 
ner consonant with his experience. Western literature has 
been profoundly affected by the theme of man's spiritual 
tempering through love, spread mainly by such Spanish 
Arabs as the tenth-century Ibn Masarra of OSrdopa, Ibn Bar- 
rajan of Seville, Abu Bakr of Granada (a Majorcan by 
birth), and Ibn Qasi of Agarabis in Portugal. The best 
known Sufi scholar was the twelfth-century Averroes (Ibn 
Rushd) who transformed Christian scholastic thought. 

Sufis have always insisted on the practicality of their 
viewpoint. Metaphysics for them are useless without practi¬ 
cal illustrations of prudent human behavior, supplied both 
by popular legends and fables. Since the Popes had excom¬ 
municated the Donatist heretics for denying that a blessing 
conferred by an evil-living priest was equal t|o that con¬ 
ferred by a saint, the attitude "Don't do as I do,| but do as I 
tell you," had become a commonplace in Catholic churches. 
Gospel authority was found in Matthew xxiii, 2 et seq., 
where Jesus tells his disciples to obey the Pharisaic teaching 
in every detail but not to model themselves on the more 
formalistic Pharisees. Christians are content to use Jesus 
as the perfect and final exemplar of human behavior. The 
Sufis, however, while admitting him as a divinely inspired 
prophet, quote the text from the fourth Gospel: "Is it not 
written in your Law, I said, ye are gods?"—which means 
that judges and prophets are entitled to interpret God's law 
—and hold that this quasi divinity should suffice any man 
or woman, there being no god but God. They have similarly 
refused to accept the Lamaism of Tibet, and Indian theories 
of divine incarnation; and though charged by orthodox Mos¬ 
lems with being influenced by Christianity, they accept the 
Nativity only as a parable of the powers latent in man 
which can set him apart from his unilluminated brothers. 
Likewise they interpret the supernatural traditions of the 
Koran as metaphorical, and to be literally believed in by the 
unenlightened alone. Paradise, for example, has not, they 
say, been experienced by any living man; its houris ("crea- 



INTRODU CHON 


xvii 


tures of light”) offer no analogy to any human beings and 
should be given no physical attributes, as in vulgar fable. 

Instances abound in all European literature of the debt 
to the Sufis. The legend of Wilhelm Tell is found in Attar's 
Parliament of the Birds (twelfth century) long before its 
appearance in Switzerland; and that the Germanic archer 
guilds (if we can trust the Malleus Maleficarum, a witch- 
hunting manual of 1460), shot “in the Devil's name” at 
apples similarly placed suggests Saracen influence. Al¬ 
though Don Quixote (pronounced “Kishotte” by the Ara¬ 
gonese and Provencals) seems the most Spanish of all Span¬ 
iards, Cervantes himself acknowledges his indebtedness to 
an Arabic source. 

This attribution has been dismissed as a quixotic joke by 
scholars; but Cervantes' stories often closely follow those of 
Sidi Kishar, a legendary Sufi teacher sometimes equated 
with Nasrudin, including the famous incident of his mis¬ 
taking mills (water mills, however, not windmills) for 
giants. The Spanish word Quijada (Quixote's real name, 
according to Cervantes) derives from the same Arabic root 
KSHR as Kishar, and retains its sense of “threatening 
grimaces.” The Blessed Raymond Lully, a Majorcan 
mystic and martyr, admits to having written his famous 
poem The Book of the Lover and His Beloved (1283) on the 
Sufic model. And Brother Anselm of Turmeda, a Catalan 
Christian mystic, was well known also as the illuminated 
Sufi sage Abdulla el-Tarjuman, “the Interpreter.” 

Friar Roger Bacon, who lectured on philosophy at Ox¬ 
ford and is buried there, had studied in Saracen Spain; 
but carefully avoiding a direct reference to the 'Illuminates,” 
for fear of offending the university authorities, he calls this 
way of thought merely “Eastern," a word which in Arabic is 
formed from the same root as “iUuminism." Professor Asm of 
Madrid and his associates have traced Bacon's indebtedness 
to the illuminates of the C6rdoba school founded by Ibn 
Masarra (883-931). This school was developed by the Jew¬ 
ish Sufic sage Solomon ben Gabirol (1021—1058) known

THE SUFIS 


to the Saracens as Suleiman ibn Yahya ibn Jabriol, and to 
the Christians as Avicebron. Avicebron has how been es¬ 
tablished as the vital influence behind St. Francis of As¬ 
sisi's founding of the Franciscan Order, which Bacon joined 
in 1247. A passage from one o£ Bacon's Latin works refers 
to the Sufic evolutionary theory: 

Nor do the natural philosophers know of this, neither 
the whole assembly of Latin writers. And because this 
science is not known to the generality of students it 
necessarily follows that they are ignorant jof all that 
depends upon it, as regards the generation jof animate 
things, of plants and beasts, and men; for, being igno¬ 
rant of what comes before, they are necessarily ignorant 
of what follows. 

Though Friar Bacon has been looked on with awe and 
suspicion because he studied the "Black Arts," the word 
"black" does not signify "evil." It is a play on two Arabic 
roots FHM and FHHM, pronounced fecham and fachcm, 
one of which means “black” and the other “wise." The same 
play occurs in the arms of Hugues de Payns ("of the 
Pagans"), bom in 1070, 8 who founded the Order of 
Knights Templars: namely three Saracen heajds sable, bla¬ 
zoned as if cut off in battle, but really denoting heads of 
wisdom. 

The Moslem Sufis were fortunate enough to protect them¬ 
selves against charges of heresy by the efforts of El-Ghazali 
(1058-1 hi), known in Europe as Algazel,jwho became 
the highest doctrinal authority in Islam and rjecondled Ko¬ 
ranic religious myth with rationalistic philosophy, thus earn¬ 
ing the title "Proof of Islam." Nevertheless, they were fre¬ 
quently the victims of pogroms in less enlightened regions, 
and were forced to adopt secret passwords, grips, and other

ruses in self-protection. In the West, no Christian Sufi of 
sufficient ecclesiastical authority could be found to protect 
his fellows at the great Church councils, but Sufi thought 
continued to be a secret force running parallel to orthodox 
Christianity. Hence the admiration, mixed with suspicion, 
which greeted Friar Roger Bacon, the Blessed Raymond 
Lully (who has waited seven hundred years for canoniza¬ 
tion), and other Sufis credited with strange powers and 
stranger doctrines. Yet the Sufic works of Ghazali were cited 
by Averroes and Abu Baler—“Abubacer”—writers of im¬ 
mense prestige at the Christian universities. 

“The Sufis are an ancient spiritual freemasonry. . . ” In¬ 
deed, Freemasonry itself began as a Sufi society. It first 
reached England in the reign of King Aethelstan (924-939) 
and was introduced into Scotland disguised as a craft guild at 
the beginning of the fourteenth century, doubtless by the 
Knights Templars. 4 Its reformation in early eighteenth- 
century London, by a group of Protestant sages who mis¬ 
took its Saracen terms for Hebrew, has obscured many of 
its early traditions. Richard Burton, translator of the Thou¬ 
sand and One Nights, being both a Freemason and a Sufi, 
first pointed out the close relation between the two societies, 
but he was not sufficiently advanced in either to realize that 
Freemasonry had begun as a Sufi group. Idries Shah Sayed 
now shows that it was a metaphor for the “reedification,” 
or rebuilding, of spiritual man from his ruined state; and 
that the three working instruments displayed on modem 
Masonic lodges represent three postures of prayer. “Buizz” 
or “Boaz” and “Solomon, Son of David,” who are honored 
by Freemasons as builders at King Solomon's temple at Je¬ 
rusalem, were not Solomon's Israelite subjects or Phoenician 

4 There is a shadowy tradition among Masons of the Craft's 
Saracenic origins. Haydn's Dictionary of Dates (1867, p. 347) 
quotes Masonic historians in saying that “it is said that architects 
horn the African coast, Mahometans, brought it into Spain, about 
the ninth century." That the successive degrees mark the actual pass¬ 
ing through certain definite spiritual experiences, allegorized by their 
rituals, is less understood.

allies as is supposed, but Abdel-Malik’s Sufi architects who 
built the Dome of the Rock on the ruins of Solomon's tem¬ 
ple, and their successors* Their real names included Thu- 
ban abdel Faiz (“Izz"), and his “great grandson," Maaruf, 
the son (disciple) of David of Tay, whose Sufic code name 
was Solomon, because he was the “son of David." The archi¬ 
tectural measurements chosen for this Temple, as for the 
Kaaba building at Mecca, were numerical equivalents of 
certain Arabic roots conveying holy messages, every part of 
the building being related to every other in definite pro¬ 
portion. 

According to English academic principle, a fish is not the 
best teacher of ichthyology, nor is an angel of angelology. 
Hence most authoritative modem books and articles about 
Sufism are written by historically minded European and 
American university professors who have never swum in 
Sufic depths nor soared to ecstatic Sufic heights, and do not 
even understand Perso-Arabic poetic wordplay. I pleaded 
with Idries Shah Sayed to remedy this lack of accurate public 
information, if only to reassure natural Sufis in the West 
that they are not alone in their peculiar habits of thought, 
and that their intuitions can be sharpened by others' ex¬ 
perience. He consented, though aware that this would be a 
task of great difficulty. Idries Shah Sayed happens to be in 
the senior male line of descent from the prophet! Mohammed, 
and to have inherited the secret mysteries fromj the Caliphs, 
his ancestors. He is, in fact, a Grand Sheikh of the Sufi 
Tariqa (“Rule"), but since all Sufis are by definition equal 
and responsible only to themselves for their pwn spiritual 
achievements, “Sheikh" is a misleading tide. It does not 
mean “leader" so much as “fugleman," the old army term for 
the soldier who stood in front of a company on the parade 
ground as an exemplar in arms-drill. 

The difficulty that he foresaw (though many years resi¬ 
dent in Europe and as conversant with English and the 
main European languages as with Arabic, Pushtu, Urdu, 
classical and modern Persian) is that readers of this book

must be assumed to have perceptions out of the ordinary, a 
poetic imagination, a strong sense of honor, and to have 
already stumbled on the main secret, which is a great deal to 
expect. Nor does he wish to be thought a missionary. Sufi 
teachers do their best to discourage disciples, and accept 
none that come “empty-handed,” that is to say, who lack 
an inborn sense of the central mystery. A disciple learns less 
from his teacher in the way of literary or therapeutic tradi¬ 
tion than from watching him deal with the problems of daily 
life; and must not plague him with questions but accept on 
trust a great deal of apparent illogic and foolishness which 
will make eventual sense. Many of the main Sufic paradoxes 
are current in the form of comic stories, especially those 
centered around the Khoja (schoolmaster) Nasrudin, and 
occur also in the fables of Aesop, whom the Sufis accept as 
one of their ancestors. 

The court fool of the Spanish kings with his bladder stick, 
his motley clothes, cock crest, jingling bells, simple wisdom 
and utter disrespect of authority is a Sufi figure. His jokes 
were accepted by the sovereigns as having a deeper wisdom 
than the most solemn advice of eldest councillors. When 
Philip II of Spain was accentuating his persecution of Jews, 
he decided that every Spaniard with Jewish blood must 
wear a hat of a certain shape. Foreseeing trouble, the fool 
appeared the same evening with three such hats. “For whom 
are these, fool?” asked Philip. “One for me, nuncle, one for 
thee, and one for the Grand Inquisitor.” And since it was 
true that numerous medieval Spanish aristocrats had mar¬ 
ried into rich Jewish families, Philip thereupon abandoned 
his plan. In much the same way, Charles Fs court fool 
Charlie Armstrong (once a Scottish sheep stealer), whom he 
had inherited from his father, tried to oppose Archbishop 
Laud's Arminian Church policy, which seemed bound to 
end in an armed clash with the Puritans. Charles scornfully

In effect, this book is not addressed to intellectuals or 
other orthodox thinkers, or to anyone who will fail to recog¬ 
nize it at once as addressed to himself. The economics of 
publication will of course distribute the book mosdy among 
readers without much sense of what the author is saying; 
yet if he had written in a way that they clearly understood, 
he would have been saying something altogether different. 
An awkward position; and if anyone deserves the blame 
for publication, it is myself. Nevertheless Idries Shah Sayed 
supplies a great deal of unexpected information—besides 
what I have already quoted—such as the Saracen origin of 
the rosary and of Hans Andersen’s Ugly Duckling, or 
Chaucer’s debt to well-known Sufi poets, emphasizing these 
secondary phenomena without prejudice to the primary 
phenomenon of Sufi thought. The book will at least be avail¬ 
able to a great number of people who share this peculiar way 
of thinking with one or two intimate friends, and whom 
it will doubtless surprise as much as it has surprised me.

Author’s Preface 


The last thing that is intended in the writing of this book 
is that it should be considered inimical to scholasticism or to 
the academic method. Scholars of the East and the West have 
heroically consecrated their whole working lives to making 
available, by means of their own disciplines, Sufi literary 
and philosophical material to the world at large. In many 
cases they have faithfully recorded the Sufis’ own reitera¬ 
tion that the Way of the Sufis cannot be understood by 
means of the intellect or by ordinary book learning. That 
this fundamental has not prevented them from trying to 
bring Sufism within the compass of their own understanding 
is a tribute to their intellectual honesty and their faith in 
their own system of examination. 

It would, however, be false to Sufism not to affirm that it 
cannot be appreciated beyond a certain point except within 
the real teaching situation, which requires the physical 
presence of a Sufi teacher. For the Sufi, it is no accident that 
the “secret doctrine” whose existence has for uncounted 
time been suspected and sought proves so elusive to the 
seeker. If, say, communism is a religion without a god, 
academic study of Sufism without being to any extent a 
“working Sufi” is Sufism without its essential factor. If this 
assertion militates against the rational tradition that an in¬ 
dividual can find truth merely through the exercise of the 
faculties with which he finds himself endowed, there is only 
one answer. Sufism, the “secret tradition,” is not available 
on the basis of assumptions which belong to another world,

THE SUFIS 


the world of intellect. If it is felt that truth about extraphys¬ 
ical fact must be sought only through a certain jway of think¬ 
ing, the rational and “scientific” one, there can be no contact 
between the Sufi and the supposedly objective seeker. 

Sufi literature and preparatory teaching is designed to 
help to bridge the gap between these two worlds of thought 
Were it not possible to provide any bridge at jail, this book 
would be worthless, and should not have been attempted. 

Sufism, considered as a nutrient for society, is not in¬ 
tended to subsist within society in an unaltered form. That 
is to say, the Sufis do not erect systems as one would build 
an edifice, for succeeding generations to examine and learn 
from. Sufism is transmitted by means of the human exemplar, 
the teacher. Because he is an unfamiliar figure to the world 
at large, or because he has imitators, does not mean that 
he does not exist | 

We find traces of Sufism in derelict organizations from 
which this element of human transmission of baraka has 
ceased; where the form alone remains. Since it is this outer 
shell which is most easily perceptible to the ordinary man, 
we have to use it to point to something deeper. Unlike him, 
we cannot say that such and such a ritual, such and such a 
book, incarnates Sufism. We start with human, social, liter¬ 
ary material that is both incomplete (because now unaccom¬ 
panied by the impact of the living exemplar, the teacher) 
and secondary, in that it is only partially absorbed. Historical 
facts, such as religious and social organization, when they 
persist, are secondary, external phenomena which depend 
upon organization, emotion and outward show for their sur¬ 
vival. These factors, so essential for the continuation of 
familiar systems, are, Sufistically speaking, only the sub¬ 
stitute for the vitality of organism, as distinct jfrom appear¬ 
ance and sentiment. 1 

A Sufi school comes into being, like any other natural 
factor, in order to flourish and disappear, not to leave

traces in mechanical ritual, or anthropologically interesting 
survivals. The function of a nutrient is to become trans¬ 
muted, not to leave unaltered traces. 

The great Sufi teacher Jami refers to this tendency when 
he says that if the beard is allowed to grow too bushy, it will 
vie with the hair of the head in its claims for attention or 
prominence. 

It will easily be understood that both the “organic” and 
“human exemplar” claims of Sufism remove it immediately 
from the purview of conventional study. 

There is, however, some value in paying attention to Sufi 
influences upon human culture. In the first place, we can 
observe attempts to bridge the gap between ordinary think¬ 
ing and Sufi experience, contained in poetic, literary and 
other media, which have been designed to lead the ordinary, 
attenuated or embryonic human consciousness into a greater 
perception and realization. Secondly, it is maintained by 
Sufis that even in cultures where authoritarian and 
mechanical thinking have choked comprehensive under¬ 
standing, human individuality will have to assert itself, 
somewhere, even if this be only through the primitive sense 
that life must have more meaning than the officially prop¬ 
agated one. 

In this book, emphasis has been placed upon the diffusion 
of Sufic thought during a certain phase (from the seventh 
century of the current era) for illustrative purposes. If, in 
the process, material which is completely new has been pre¬ 
sented, this is not done for any purpose of scholastic effort. 
Scholasticism is interested in accumulating information and 
making deductions from it. Sufism is engaged upon develop¬ 
ing a line of communication with ultimate knowledge, not 
with combining individual facts, however historically ex¬ 
citing, or theorizing in any way at all. 

Sufism, it should be remembered, is Eastern thought only 
insofar as it retains beliefs—such as the human exemplar— 
which have fallen into abeyance in the West. It is occult 
and mystical inasmuch as it follows a path other than that 


XXvJ THE SUFIS 

which has been represented as the true one by authoritarian 
and dogmatic organization. Sufism claims that the latter 
attitude constitutes only a part, only a phase, in the human 
story, riming a “real” source o£ knowledge, Sufism can¬ 
not accept the pretensions of the temporary phase which, 
viewed from within itself, is currently considered to be the 
“logical” one. 

A great deal of the material presented here ip incomplete 
because it is not possible to increase the amount of formal 
literature about Sufism without the balance of Sufic prac¬ 
tice. Much of it, nevertheless, is unknown outside traditional 
Sufic circles. It is not intended to influence traditional 
scholasticism, with which it has only the most superficial 
rnnnprrinn; and one which cannot be carried; far without 
distortion. 

Sufism is known by means of itself. 

It is interesting to note the difference between science as 
we know it today, and as it was seen by one of its pioneers. 
Roger Bacon, considered to be the wonder of the middle 
ages and one of humanity's greatest thinkers, was the pio¬ 
neer of the method of knowledge gained through experi¬ 
ence. This Franciscan monk learned from the Sufis of the 
illuminist school that there is a difference between the collec¬ 
tion of information and the knowing of things through 
actual experiment. In his Opus Maius, in which he quotes 
Sufi authority, he says: 

There are two modes of knowledge, through argument 
and experience. Argument brings conclusions and com¬ 
pels us to concede them, but it does not cause certainty 
nor remove doubts in order that the mind may remain 
at rest in truth, unless this is provided by experience. 

This Sufi doctrine is known in the West as j the scientific 
method of inductive proceeding, and subsequent Western 

science is largely based upon it. i 

Modem science, however, instead of accepting the idea 
that experience was necessary in all branches of human 



author's preface xxvii 

thought, took the word in its sense of “experiment,” in 
which the experimenter remained as far as possible outside 
the experience. 

From the Sufi point of view, therefore, Bacon, when he 
wrote these words in 1268, both launched modem science 
and also transmitted only a portion of the wisdom upon 
which it could have been based. 

“Scientific” thinking has worked continuously and heroi¬ 
cally with this partial tradition ever since. In spite of its 
roots in the work of the Sufis, the impairment of the tradi¬ 
tion has prevented the scientific researcher from approach¬ 
ing knowledge by means of itself—by “experience,” not 
merely “experiment.” 


The Situation 


Humanity is asleep, concerned only with what is useless, 
living in a wrong world. Believing that one can excel this 
is only habit and usage, not religion. This “religion” is 
inept. . . . 

Do not prattle before the People of the Path, rather con¬ 
sume yourself. You have an inverted knowledge and reli¬ 
gion if you are upside down in relation to Reality. 

Man is wrapping his net around himself. A lion (the 
man of the Way) bursts his cage asunder. 

(The Sufi master Sanai of Afghanistan, teacher of Rumi, in The 
Walled Garden of Truth, written in 1131 A.D.) 


The Islanders 


The ordinary man repents his sins: 
the elect repent o£ their heedlessness. 

(DhuTNun Misri) 


Most fables contain at least some truth, and they often 
enable people to absorb ideas which the ordinary patterns 
of their thinking would prevent them from digesting. Fables 
have therefore been used, not least by the Sufi teachers, to 
present a picture of life more in harmony with their feelings 
than is possible by means of intellectual exercises. 

Here is a Sufic fable about the human situation, summa¬ 
rized and adapted, as must always be, suitably to the time 
in which it is presented. Ordinary “entertainment” fables 
are considered by Sufi authors to be a degenerated or infe¬ 
rior form of art. 

Once upon a time there lived an ideal community in a 
far-off land. Its members had no fears as we now know 
them. Instead of uncertainty and vacillation, they had pur¬ 
posefulness and a fuller means of expressing themselves. 
Although there were none of the stresses and tensions which 
mankind now considers essential to its progress, their lives 
were richer, because other, better elements replaced these 
things. Theirs, therefore, was a slightly different mode of 


2 


THE SOTIS 


existence. We could almost say that our present perceptions 
are a crude, makeshift version of the real ones which this 
community possessed. 

They had real lives, not semilives. 

We can call them the El Ar people. 

They had a leader, who discovered that their country was 
to become uninhabitable for a period of, shall we say, 
twenty thousand years. He planned their escape, realizing 
that their descendants would be able to return home suc¬ 
cessfully, only after many trials. 

He found for them a place of refuge, an island whose 
features were only roughly similar to those of the original 
homeland. Because of the difference in climate and situa¬ 
tion, the immigrants had to undergo a transformation. This 
made them more physically and mentally adapted to the 
new circumstances; coarse perceptions, for instance, were 
substituted for finer ones, as when the hand of the manual 
laborer becomes toughened in response to the needs of his 
calling. 

In order to reduce the pain which a comparison between 
the old and new states would bring, they were made to for¬ 
get the past almost entirely. Only the most shadowy recol¬ 
lection of it remained, yet it was sufficient to be awakened 
when the time came. 

The system was very complicated, but well arranged. The 
organs by means of which the people survived on the island 
were also made the organs of enjoyment, physical and men¬ 
tal. The organs which were really constructive in the old 
homeland were placed in a special form of abeyance, and 
linked with the shadowy memory, in preparation for its 
eventual activation. 

Slowly and painfully the immigrants settled down, ad¬ 
justing themselves to the local conditions. The resources of 
the island were such that, coupled with effort and a cer¬ 
tain form of guidance, people would be able to escape to a 
further island, on the way back to their original home. This 



THE ISLANDERS 


3 

was the first of a succession of islands upon which gradual 
acclimatization took place. 

The responsibility of this “evolution” was vested in those 
individuals who could sustain it. These were necessarily 
only a few, because for the mass of the people the effort of 
keeping both sets of knowledge in their consciousness 
was virtually impossible. One of them seemed to conflict 
with the other one. Certain specialists guarded the “special 
science.” 

This “secret,” the method of effecting the transition, was 
nothing more or less than the knowledge of maritime skills 
and their application. The escape needed an instructor, raw 
materials, people, effort and understanding. Given these, 
people could learn to swim, and also to build ships. 

The people who were originally in charge of the escape 
operations made it clear to everyone that a certain prepara¬ 
tion was necessary before anyone could learn to swim or 
even take part in building a ship. For a time the process 
continued satisfactorily. 

Then a man who had been found, for the time being, 
lacking in the necessary qualities rebelled against this order 
and managed to develop a masterly idea. He had observed 
that the effort to escape placed a heavy and often seemingly 
unwelcome burden upon the people. At the same time they 
were disposed to believe things which they were told about 
the escape operation. He realized that he could acquire 
power, and also revenge himself upon those who had under¬ 
valued him, as he thought, by a simple exploitation of 
these two sets of facts. 

He would merely offer to take away the burden, by 
affirming that there was no burden. 

He made this announcement: 

“There is no need for man to integrate his mind and 
train it in the way which has been described to you. The 
human mind is already a stable and continuous, consistent 
thing. You have been told that you have to become a crafts-

man in order to build a ship. I say, not only do you not need 
to be a craftsman—you do not need a ship at all! An islander 
needs only to observe a few simple rules to survive and re¬ 
main integrated into society. By the exercise of common 
sense, bom into everyone, he can attain anything upon 
this island, our home, the common property and heritage of 

•nr 

The tonguester, having gained a great deal of interest 
among the people, now "proved” his message by saying: 

"If there is any reality in ships and swimming, show us 
ships which have made the journey, and swimmers who 
have come back!” 

This was a challenge to the instructors which they could 
not meet. It was based upon an assumption of which the 
bemused herd could not now see the fallacy. You see, 
ships never returned from the other land. Swimmers, when 
they did come back, had undergone a fresh adaptation 
which made them invisible to the crowd. 

The mob pressed for demonstrative proof. 

"Shipbuilding,” said the escapers, in an attempt to reason 
with the revolt, "is an art and a craft. The learning and the 
exercise of this lore depends upon special techniques. These 
together make up a total activity, which cannot be examined 
piecemeal, as you demand. This activity has an impalpable 
element, called baraka, from which the word 'barque—a 
ship—is derived. This word means 'the Subtlety/ and it can¬ 
not be shown to you.” 

"Art, craft, total, baraka, nonsense!” shouted the revolu¬ 
tionaries. 

And so they hanged as many shipbuilding craftsmen as 
they could find. 

The new gospel was welcomed on all sides as one of liber¬ 
ation. Man had discovered that he was already mature! He 
felt, for the time at least, as if he had been released from 
responsibility. 

Most other ways of thinking were soon swamped by

the simplicity and comfort of the revolutionary concept. 
Soon it was considered to be a basic fact which had never 
been challenged by any rational person. Rational, of course, 
meant anyone who harmonized with the general theory it¬ 
self, upon which society was now based. 

Ideas which opposed the new one were easily called ir¬ 
rational. Anything irrational was bad. Thereafter, even 
if he had doubts, the individual had to suppress them or 
divert them, because he must at all costs be thought rational. 

It was not very difficult to be rational. One had only to 
adhere to the values of society. Further, evidence of the 
truth of rationality abounded—providing that one did not 
think beyond the life of the island. 

Society had now temporarily equilibrated itself within 
the island, and seemed to provide a plausible completeness, 
if viewed by means of itself. It was based upon reason plus 
emotion, making both seem plausible. Cannibalism, for in¬ 
stance, was permitted on rational grounds. The human body 
was found to be edible. Edibility was a characteristic of 
food. Therefore the human body was food. In order to 
compensate for the shortcomings of this reasoning, a make¬ 
shift was arranged. Cannibalism was controlled, in the 
interests of society. Compromise was the trademark of 
temporary balance. Every now and again someone pointed 
out a new compromise, and the struggle between reason, 
ambition and community produced some fresh social norm. 

Since the skills of boatbuilding had no obvious applica¬ 
tion within this society, the effort could easily be considered 
absurd. Boats were not needed—there was nowhere to go. 
The consequences of certain assumptions can be made to 
"prove” those assumptions. This is what is called pseudo¬ 
certainty, the substitute for real certainty. It is what we 
deal in every day, when we assume that we will live another 
day. But our islanders applied it to everything. 

Two entries in the great Island Universal Encyclopaedia 
show us how the process worked. Distilling their wisdom

from the only mental nutrition available to them, the is¬ 
land's savants produced, in all honesty, this kind of truth: 

SHIP: Displeasing . An imaginary vehicle in which 
impostors and deceivers have claimed it possible to 
"cross the water," now scientifically established as an 
absurdity. No materials impermeable to water are 
known on the Island, from which such a "ship" might 
be constructed, quite apart from the question of there 
being a destination beyond the Island. Preaching 
"shipbuilding” is a major crime under Law XVII of 
the Penal Code, subsection J, The Protection of the 
Credulous. SHIPBUILDING MANIA is an extreme 
form of mental escapism, a symptom of maladjustment 
All citizens are under a constitutional obligation to 
notify the health authorities if they suspect the exist¬ 
ence of this tragic condition in any individual.

Readings: Smith, J., Why “Ships” Cannot he Built, Is¬

SWIMMING: Unpleasant . Supposedly a method of 
propelling the body through water without drowning, 
generally for the purpose of "reaching a place outside 
the Island." The "student" of this unpleasant art had to 
submit himself to a grotesque ritual. In the first lesson, 
he had to prostrate himself on the ground, and move 
his arms and legs in response to the commands of an 
"instructor." The entire concept is based upon the de¬ 
sire of the self-styled "instructors" to dominate the 
credulous in barbaric times. More recently the cult has 
taken the form of epidemic mania.

The words "displeasing" and "unpleasant" were used on 
the island to indicate anything which conflicted with the 



THE ISLANDERS 


7 

new gospel, which was itself known as "Please.” The idea 
behind this was that people would now please themselves, 
within the general need to please the State. The State was 
taken to mean all the people. 

It is hardly surprising that from quite early times the 
very thought of leaving the island filled most people with 
terror. Similarly, very real fear is to be seen in long-term 
prisoners who are about to be released. "Outside” the place 
of captivity is a vague, unknown, threatening world. 

The island was not a prison. But it was a cage with in¬ 
visible bars, more effective than obvious ones ever could 
be. 

The insular society became more and more complex, and 
we can look at only a few of its outstanding features. Its 
literature was a rich one. In addition to cultural composi¬ 
tions there were numerous books which explained the 
values and achievements of the nation. There was also a 
system of allegorical fiction which portrayed how terrible 
life might have been, had society not arranged itself in the 
present reassuring pattern. 

From time to time instructors tried to help the whole com¬ 
munity to escape. Captains sacrificed themselves for the 
reestablishment of a climate in which the now concealed 
shipbuilders could continue their work. All these efforts 
were interpreted by historians and sociologists with refer¬ 
ence to conditions on the island, without thought for any 
contact outside this closed society. Plausible explanations of 
almost anything were comparatively easy to produce. No 
principle of ethics was involved, because scholars continued 
to study with genuine dedication what seemed to be true. 
"What more can we do?” they asked, implying by the word 
"more” that the alternative might be an effort of quantity. 
Or they asked each other, “What else can we do?” ass umi ng 
that the answer might be in "else”—something different. 
Their real problem was that they assumed themselves able 
to formulate the questions, and ignored the fact that the 
questions were every bit as important as the answers.

THE SUFIS 


Of course the islanders had plenty of scope for thought 
and action within their own small domain. The variations 
of ideas and differences of opinion gave the impression of 
freedom of thought Thought was encouraged, providing 
that it was not “absurd.” 

Freedom of speech was allowed. It was of little use with¬ 
out the development of understanding, which was not 
pursued 

The work and the emphasis of the navigators had to take 
on different aspects in accordance with the changes in the 
community. This made their reality even more baffling to 
the students who tried to follow them from the island point 
of view. 

Amid all the confusion, even the capacity to remember 
the possibility of escape could at times become an obstacle. 
The stirring consciousness of escape potential was not very 
discriminating. More often than not the eager would-be 
escapers settled for any kind of substitute. A vague concept 
of navigation cannot become useful without orientation. 
Even the most eager potential shipbuilders had been 
trained to believe that they already had that orientation. 
They were already mature. They hated anyone who pointed 
out that they might need a preparation. 

Bizarre versions of swimming or shipbuilding often 
crowded out possibilities of real progress. Very much to 
blame were the advocates of pseudoswimming or allegori¬ 
cal ships, mere hucksters, who offered lessons to those as 
yet too weak to swim, or passages on ships which they 
could not build. 

The needs of the society had originally made necessary 
certain forms of efficiency and thinking which developed 
into what was known as science. This admirable approach, 
so essential in the fields where it had an application, finally 
outran its real meaning. The approach called “scientific,” 
soon after the “Please” revolution, became stretched until it 
covered all manner of ideas. Eventually things which could 
not be brought within its bounds became known as “un- 



THE ISLANDERS 


9 

scientific,” another convenient synonym for “bad.” Words 
were unknowingly taken prisoner and then automatically 
enslaved. 

In the absence of a suitable attitude, like people who, 
thrown upon their own resources in a waiting room, fever¬ 
ishly read magazines, the islanders absorbed themselves in 
finding substitutes for the fulfillment which was the origi¬ 
nal (and indeed the final) purpose of this community's 
exile. 

Some were able to divert their attention more or less suc¬ 
cessfully into mainly emotional commitments. There were 
different ranges of emotion, but no adequate scale for 
measuring them. All emotion was considered to be “deep” 
or “profound”—at any rate more profound than nonemo¬ 
tion. Emotion, which was seen to move people to the most 
extreme physical and mental acts known, was automatically 
termed “deep.” 

The majority of people set themselves targets, or allowed 
others to set them for them. They might pursue one cult 
after another, or money, or social prominence. Some wor¬ 
shiped some things and felt themselves superior to all the 
rest. Some, by repudiating what they thought worship was, 
thought that they had no idols, and could therefore safely 
sneer at all the rest. 

As the centuries passed, the island was littered with the 
debris of these cults. Worse than ordinary debris, it was self- 
perpetuating. Well-meaning and other people combined the 
cults and recombined them, and they spread anew. For the 
amateur and intellectual, this constituted a mine of aca¬ 
demic or “initiatory” material, giving a comforting sense of 
variety. 

Magnificent facilities for the indulging of limited “satis¬ 
factions” proliferated. Palaces and monuments, museums 
and universities, institutes of learning, theaters and sports 
stadiums almost filled the island. The people naturally 
prided themselves on these endowments, many of which 
they considered to be linked in a general way with ultimate 


10 


THE SUEIS 


truth, though exactly how this was so escaped almost all of 
them. 

Shipbuilding was connected with some dimensions of 
this activity, but in a way unknown to almost everyone. 

Clandestinely the ships raised their sails, the swimmers 
continued to teach swimming. ... 

The conditions on the island did not entirely fill these 
dedicated people with dismay. After all, they too had orig¬ 
inated in the very same community, and had indissoluble 
bonds with it, and with its destiny. 

But they very often had to preserve themselves from the 
attentions of their fellow citizens. Some “normal” islanders 
tried to save them from themselves. Others tried to Mil 
them, for an equally sublime reason. Some even sought their 
help eagerly, but could not find them. 

All these reactions to the existence of the swimmers were 
the result of the same cause, filtered through different kinds 
of minds. This cause was that hardly anyone now knew 
what a swimmer really was, what he was doing, or where 
he could be found. 

As the life of the island became more and more civilized, 
a strange but logical industry grew up. It was devoted to 
ascribing doubts to the validity of the system under which 
society lived. It succeeded in absorbing doubts about social 
values by laughing at them or satirizing them. The activity 
could wear a sad or happy face, but it really became a 
repetitious ritual. A potentially valuable industry, it was 
often prevented from exercising its really creative function. 

People felt that, having allowed their doubts to have tem¬ 
porary expression, they would in some way assuage them, 
exorcise them, almost propitiate them. Satire passed for 
meaningful allegory; allegory was accepted but not digested. 
Plays, books, films, poems, lampoons were the usual media 
for this development, though there was a strong section of 
it in more academic fields. For many islanders it seemed 
more emancipated, more modem or progressive, to follow 
this cult rather than older ones.

Here and there a candidate still presented himself to a 
swimming instructor, to make his bargain. Usually what 
amounted to a stereotyped conversation took place. 

“I want to learn to swim." 

“Do you want to make a bargain about it?” 

“No. I only have to take my ton of cabbage.” 

“What cabbage?” 

“The food which I will need on the other island.” 

“There is better food there.” 

“I don't know what you mean. I cannot be sure. I 
must take my cabbage.” 

“You cannot swim, for one thing, with a ton of 
cabbage.” 

“Then I cannot go. You call it a load. I call it my es¬ 
sential nutrition.” 

“Suppose, as an allegory, we say not 'cabbage,' but 
'assumptions,' or 'destructive ideas'?” 

“I am going to take my cabbage to some instructor 
who understands my needs.” 

This book is about some of the swimmers and builders of 
ships, and also about some of the others who tried to follow 
them, with more or less success. The fable is not ended, 
because there are still people on the island. 

The Sufis use various ciphers to convey their meaning. 
Rearrange the name of the original community—El Ar—to 
spell “Real.” Perhaps you had already noticed that the name 
adopted by the revolutionaries—“Please”—rearranges to form 
the word “Asleep.” 


The Background 

I. The Travelers and the Grapes 


There are three forms of culture: worldly 
culture, the mere acquisition of information; 
religious culture, following rules; elite 
culture, self-development. 

(The master Hujwiri, Revelation of the Veiled ) 


There is a story in Aesop’s fables about a young mole who 
went to his mother and told her that he could see. Now, as 
most people know, sight is something traditionally lacking 
in moles. This one’s mother decided to test him. She accord¬ 
ingly placed in front of him a piece of frankincense, and 
asked him what it was. 

“A stone,” said the little mole. 

“Not only are you blind,” his mother answered, “but 
you have lost your sense of smell as well.” 

Aesop, esteemed traditionally by Sufis as a practical 
teacher in an immemorial tradition of wisdom gained 
through the conscious exercise of the mind, body and per¬ 
ceptions, is not allowed much distinction by the overt mean¬ 
ing of this tale. The lameness of some of the morals (actually 
superficial glosses) of the Aesopian stories has been noticed 
by many students. 

We can analyze the story to see what it really means, if 
we know something of the Sufi tradition and its method of 
concealing meanings in literature.

“Mole" in Arabic (khuld, from the radical KHLD) is 
written in the same way as khalad, which stands for “eter¬ 
nity, paradise, thought, mind, soul," according to the con¬ 
text. Because only the consonants are written, there is no 
way of telling, in isolation, which word is intended. If this 
word were used poetically in a Semitic language and then 
translated into Greek by someone who did not understand 
the double meaning, the play upon words would be lost. 

Why the stone and scent? Because, in Sufi tradition, 
“Moses [a guide to his people ] made a stone as fragrant as 
musk" (Hakim Sanai, The Walled Garden of Truth ). 

“Moses" symbolizes a guiding thought, which transforms 
something apparendy inanimate and inert into something 
“as fragrant as musk"—something with what might almost 
be called a life of its own. 

Our story now shows us that the “mother" of the thought 
(its origin, matrix, essential quality) presents “frankin¬ 
cense" (impalpable experience) to the thought, or mind. 
Because the individual (the mole) is concentrating upon 
“sight" (trying to develop faculties in the wrong order) it 
even loses the power to use the ones which it should have. 

The human being, according to the Sufis, instead of 
reaching within himself in a certain manner in order to 
find and attain his development, searches outside, and fol¬ 
lows illusions (metaphysical systems wrongly developed) 
which in fact cripple him. 

What is the inner potentiality of the “mole?" We can now 
look at the whole group of words in Arabic which belong 
to the root KHLD which we are considering: 

Khalad (KHaLaD) = ever abiding, long-lasting 

Khallad (KHaLLaD) = to perpetuate a thing 

Akhlad (AKHLaD) = to lean toward, to adhere 

faithfully to (a friend) 

Khuld (KHuLD) = eternity, paradise, continuity 

Khuld (KHuLD) = mole, field rat, lark (bird) 

Khalad (KHaLaD) = thought, mind, soul 



THE SUFIS 


14 

El-Khualid (EL-KHUALiD) = mountains, rocks, 

supporters (of a 
pot) 

To the Sufi, this grouping of words around a basic root 
conveys essentials for human forward development. It is 
almost a map of Sufism. The mole, because of coincidence, 
can be chosen as the symbol of the mind, or thought. In 
the same mind there is eternity, continuity, support. Sufism 
is concerned with the perpetuation of the human conscious¬ 
ness through its source in the mind. Faithfulness in associa¬ 
tion with others is an essential of this task. 

The Aesopian story, therefore, does not mean, as its 
commentators would believe, that Tt is easy to unmask an 
impostor." We need not deny that the tale could have ful¬ 
filled this function for centuries. But the use of the incense 
and the mole, plus the Sufi tradition that certain secrets are 
concealed in such words as those of Aesop, helps us to un¬ 
lock the door. Looking at a great deal of literary and philo¬ 
sophical material in this light, we are irresistibly reminded 
of the message of Rumi, himself, like Aesop, a great fabulist 
of Asia Minor. He says that the canal may not itself drink, 
but it performs the function of conveying water to the 
thirsty. Those who are interested in this interpretation of 
the mole symbolism might well feel that the light-hearted 
potted wisdom of Aesop has been the carrier of the nutrition 
which we now find in it. 

Rumi lived nearly two thousand years after Aesop, and 
he said: “A tale, fictitious or otherwise, illuminates truth." 

There is no need to pursue the Arabic language itself as 
the actual source of the Semitic version from which this 
Aesopian tale comes. Arabic is useful to us as a tool because, 
as philologists have demonstrated, it retains in dose assoda- 
tion words grouped according to a primitive pattern 
whose meanings have become very corrupted in the other 
Semitic languages. 

There are, in the West as well as the East, quite nu- 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 15 

merous examples of similar crystallization of teaching in 
literature, ritual and folk belief. Many such phenomena are 
considered unimportant: like the jokes attributed to 
Nasrudin, Joe Miller and others, read for their face value. 
Much of Omar Khayyam's poetry, intended to make the 
reader think clearly through reducing life to absurdity, has 
been taken in the superficial sense that Khayyam was a 
“pessimist.” Platonic material, intended according to the 
Sufis to show the limitations of formal logic and the ease of 
falling into false reasoning, has been considered defective, 
and nothing more. In some cases, as with Aesop, the canal 
still carries the water, though it is not recognized as a 
canal. In other formulations, people carry on meaningless 
rituals and beliefs which they have rationalized until they 
have no real dynamic and are really only of antiquarian 
interest. The great Sufi poet Jami says of them: “The dry 
cloud, waterless, can have no rain-giving quality.” And yet 
such cults, often mere counterfeits of carefully organized 
symbolism based on poetic analogy, are often seriously 
studied. Some people think that they contain certain meta¬ 
physical or magical truths, others that they are themselves 
of historical importance. 

In the cases where a cult or grouping of people are fol¬ 
lowing a theme mapped out originally on certain word 
groupings, it is impossible to understand them or even to 
trace their history unless we know that this is what origi¬ 
nally happened. Because of its peculiarly mathematical 
nature, and because it was chosen as the framework for 
presenting certain knowledge to the East and West during 
the middle ages, Arabic is most important in this study. 

Again, because of the almost algebraic method of produc¬ 
ing words from a basic three-letter form, Arabic has a great 
simplicity which would hardly have been expected by any¬ 
one who does not know it. In many cases we are dealing 
only with words, groups of consonants, not with grammar, 
syntax, even with the Arabic letters, because they can all be 
rendered sufficiently well for our purpose by means of Latin

letters. We substitute one letter for another. At the most we 
modify that letter in order to tell us which one the original 
was. This, in substance, is an art which has been used very 
widely in the countries of the East where Arabic letters and 
Sufi lore have penetrated, and used by people who have no 
deep knowledge of Arabic itself. Arabic, then, was discov¬ 
ered to be susceptible to use as a code by certain people in 
the East and also in the Latin West of the middle ages. 1 

The relationship of parent to child (mole and mother) 
is used by Sufis to denote the training toward full "sight" 
as well as the ultimate relationship between the Sufi and 
the ultimate "sight" of objective truth. To the Sufi, religious 
incarnation or effigy conveying this relationship is merely 
a rough and secondary method of portraying something 
which has happened to an individual or a group—a religious 
experience showing them the way to self-realization. 

"The perfected Sufi is great, exalted; he is sublime. 
Through love, work and harmony he has attained the high¬ 
est degree of mastership. All secrets are open to him; and 
his whole being is imbued with magical effulgence. He is 
the Guide and the Traveler on the Way of infinite beauty, 
love, attainment, power, fulfillment; the Guardian of the 
Most Ancient Wisdom, the Trailblazer to the highest 
secrets; the beloved friend whose very being elevates us, 
bringing new meaning to the spirit of humanity." 

This is one portrayal of the Sufi, by a contemporary writer 
who is not himself a Sufi, though he has lived among the 
followers of the Way of Love. 

The Sufi seems to the unregenerate man to change, but 
to those with inner perception he remains the same, because 
his essential personality is within, and not without. A scholar 
in Kashmir, which for centuries was a center of Sufi teach¬ 
ing, made in the seventeenth century what would today be 
called a survey of the general characteristics of Sufi mystics. 
This was Sirajudin, who traveled in all the adjacent coun-

tries, and even to Java, China and the Sahara, talking to 
Sufis and collecting their unwritten lore. 

"The Sufi,” he says, "is the complete man. When he says, 
Wong roses, be a rose, among thorns, be a thorn/ he is not 
inevitably referring to social behavior. The Sufis are poets 
and lovers. According to the ground in which their 
teaching grows, they are soldiers, administrators or physi¬ 
cians. According to the eyes of the beholder they may seem 
magicians, mystics, practitioners of incomprehensible arts* 
If you revere them as saints, you will benefit by their saint¬ 
hood; but if you work with them as associates, you will 
benefit from their company. To them, the world is a fashion¬ 
ing instrument, which polishes mankind. They, by identi¬ 
fication with the processes of continuous creation, are them¬ 
selves fashioners of other complete men. Some talk, others 
are silent, some walk it seems restlessly, others sit and teach. 
To understand them you must bring into action an intel¬ 
ligence which is an intuitive one, normally held down by its 
friendly enemy, the intelligence of the logical mind. Until 
you can understand illogicality, and the meaningfulness of 
it, shun the Sufis except for limited, precise, self-evident 
services." 2 

A Sufi, the Sufis, cannot be defined by any single set of 
words or ideas. By a picture, moving and made up of dif¬ 
ferent dimensions, perhaps. Rumi, one of the greatest mys¬ 
tical masters, tells us in a famous passage that the Sufi is: 

Drunk without wine; sated without food; distraught; 
foodless and sleepless; a king beneath a humble cloak; 
a treasure within a ruin; not of air and earth; not of 
fire and water; a sea without bounds. He has a hun¬ 
dred moons and skies and suns. He is wise through 
universal truth—not a scholar from a book. 3

this booklessness is something to do with theology, of all things: 
"Mere learning from books wifi not make a theologian,” he says, in a

Is he a man of religion? No, he is far, far more: “He is 
beyond atheism and faith alike—what are merit and sin to 
him? He is hidden—seek him!” 

The Sufi, as we are told in these most famous words from 
the thirteenth-century Diwan of Shams of Tabriz, is hidden; 
hidden more deeply than the practitioner of any secret 
school. Yet individual Sufis are known in their thousands, 
throughout the East. Settlements of Sufis are found in the 
lands of the Arabs, the Turks, the Persians, Afghans, In¬ 
dians, Malays. 

The more the dogged searchers of the Western world 
have tried to dig out the secrets of the Sufi, the more hope¬ 
lessly complex the task has seemed to be. Their work thus 
litters the fields of mysticism, Arabism, Orientalism, history, 
philosophy and even general literature. “The secret,” in the 
Sufi phrase, “protects itself. It is found only in the spirit 
and the practice of the Work” 

A distinguished professor of archaeology is perhaps the 
greatest living Western authority on the Sufis—because he 
is a Sufi, not because he is an academician. 

The ordinary man or woman in the East often looks upon 
the Sufi as the Westerner might imagine an Oriental mystic 
should be. A man endowed with supernatural powers, in¬ 
heritor of secrets handed down from uncounted ages, sym¬ 
bolic of wisdom and timelessness. The Sufi can read your 
thoughts, transport himself from one place to another in an 
instant, is in a special continuing relationship with things 
of another world. 

Sufis are usually believed to have healing powers, and 
there is no scarcity of people who will tell you how they 
were made whole by Sufis through a glance or in some 
other inexplicable manner. 4 Sufis are thought to excel at 
their chosen vocations: and numerous individuals are 

footnote to this. (Dr. Sell, Sufism, Christ. Lit. Soc., 1910, p. 63.) 
He finds Rumi difficult, saying ( 'Ibid p. 69), "it is only very patient 
students who can find the esoteric meaning of the poet."

pointed out as proof of this belief. They make mistakes, 
so the contention is, far less frequently than other people; 
and they approach things in a manner which nobody else 
would. Yet their actions are vindicated by events. This fact 
is attributed to a form of foreknowledge. They believe 
themselves to be taking part in the higher evolution of 
humanity. 

If popular beliefs, which may include what amounts to 
saint worship throughout the Middle East, are far-reaching, 
they are eclipsed by legends and traditions of Sufi masters, 
personalities revered by members of all faiths. The Sufi 
ancients could walk on water, describe events talcing place 
at vast distances, experience the true reality of fife. And 
much more in the same vein. When one master spoke, his 
hearers went into a state of mystical rapture and developed 
magical powers. Wherever Sufis went, mystics of other 
persuasions, often of great prominence, became their dis¬ 
ciples—sometimes without a word having been spoken. 

In the material world, Sufi ascendancy is based upon 
work and creativity, and generally accepted because of the 
achievements of individual Sufis. Sufi philosophical and 
scientific discoveries are widely considered to have been 
achieved through their special powers. The conventional 
theosophist or intellectual finds himself in the uncomforta¬ 
ble position that, although he must often deny the likeli¬ 
hood of a special form of consciousness accessible to an elite 
of this land, he has to accept that Sufis are national heroes 
in some countries, and are responsible for the development 
of classical literature in others. It is estimated that between 
twenty and forty million people are members of, or affiliated 
to, Sufi schools; and the Sufis are increasing in numbers. 

The Sufi may be your neighbor, the man across the street, 
the woman who does your chores; a recluse at times, rich 
or poor. 

No investigation into the reality of Sufism can be made 
entirely from the outside, because Sufism includes participa¬ 
tion, training and experience. Although Sufis have written 


20 


THE SUFIS 


innumerable books, these may apply to specific circum¬ 
stances, seem to contradict one another, cannot be under¬ 
stood by the uninitiated, or are found to have meanings 
other than the superficial one. They are usually studied by 
outsiders only very superficially. 

One difficulty of getting to grips with Sufism through its 
Eastern literature has been noticed by many scholars who 
have made the attempt, including Professor Nicholson, who 
labored long to understand and make available Sufic think¬ 
ing to the West. In presenting selections of some Sufi writ¬ 
ings he admits that “a great deal is peculiar and unique, 
so that the writings in which it occurs seldom impart their 
real significance except to those who possess the key to 
the cipher, while the uninitiated will either understand 
them literally or not at all.” 6 

A book such as the present one "designs itself' in a Su- 
fistic manner; for by definition it must follow a Sufic, not a 
conventional, pattern, and hence its material and treatment 
are of a special nature, not subject to approach by means of 
familiar criteria. This is the method known as "scatter,” by 
which an impact is considered effective by virtue of its mul¬ 
tiple activity. 

In ordinary life, certain forms of understanding become 
possible because of experience. The human mind is what it 
is partly because of the impacts to which it has been ex¬ 
posed, and its ability to use those impacts. The interaction 
between impact and mind determines the quality of the 
personality. In Sufism this normal physical and mental 
process is engaged in consciously. The result is felt to be 
more efficient; and "wisdom,” instead of being a matter of 
time, age and accident, is regarded as inevitable. Sufis liken 
this process to the analogy between a savage who eats 
everything and a discriminating man who eats what is good 
for him as well as tasty. 

It would be absurd to attempt to convey the meaning of 

5 R. A. Nicholson, Tales of Mystic Meaning, London, 1931, 
p. 171. 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 21 

Sufi thought and action in a conventional, simplified or 
conversational manner, for the above reasons. This ab¬ 
surdity is summarized by the Sufi tag as “sending a kiss by 
messenger.” Sufism may be natural, but it is also a part of 
higher human development, and conscious development at 
that. An adequate vehicle for its presentation usually does 
not exist in societies where it has not been operating in this 
advanced form. On the other hand, a climate for its presen¬ 
tation (part literary, part expository, part example and so 
on) has been prepared in other areas. 

Metaphysically minded people, and especially those who 
feel that they are comfortable in the domain of mysticism or 
“inner perception,” have no greater start on the generality 
of humanity where the acceptance of Sufism is concerned. 
Their subjectivity, especially where it is linked with a strong 
sense of personal uniqueness “caught” from other people, 
can in fact be a serious disability. 

There is no simplified Sufism; yet it disappears from the 
area of cognition of such ill-defined minds as may be con¬ 
fident that they can understand it, penetrate anything 
spiritual” by virtue of what is truly a woolly, self-assumed 
perceptiveness. To the Sufi, such a personality, however 
vocal he may be (and he often is) hardly exists at all. 

Anyone who says, “It is all so indescribable, but I just 
feel what you mean,” is unlikely to be able to profit by Su¬ 
fism. For Sufis are working, are carrying out an effort to 
awaken a certain field of consciousness by means of an ap¬ 
proach which is specialized, not fortuitous. Sufism does not 
trade in airy-fairiness, mutual admiration, or lukewarm gen¬ 
eralities. When the “bite” disappears, so, too, does the Sufic 
element from a situation. The converse is also true. Sufism 
is not directed to a section of the community—for no such 
section exists—but to a certain faculty within individuals. 
Where this faculty is not activated, there is no Sufism. It 
contains hard as well as soft realities, discord as well as 
harmony, the sharp brightness of awakening as well as the 
gentle dark of a lulling to sleep. 


22 


THE SUFIS 

This central factor is well expressed in Sufi poetry, which 
is often perfect in a technical sense, and sometimes human, 
sometimes startlingly different. Generations of conventional 
prosodists have spent their lives analyzing this unique prop¬ 
erty by a different yardstick—in terms of a poet’s ‘Variations 
in quality.” One Sufi poet replies like this: 

O cat with a taste for sour cream; connoisseur of 
shades of bitterness! You belong to the litter that has 
agreed about yogurt. You hate with equal meaning the 
cheese, butter, and milk warm from the udder. You 
are no cheesemonger, you say? Verily, he is closer to 
you than your jugular vein. 

And another, with an oddly modem echo of reference to 
slick writings: 

Shall we paint a perfect picture, or design a perfect 
rug? Then shall we thump our tongues all night to find 
out wherein each has strayed from perfection? This 
is good; this is a task for a complete man; and for such 
a chil d as is intent upon the consistency of the materials 
which alone will give perfection to his mud pie. 

Anyone who has tasted the firm, but not too hard, aseptic 
cheeses of the contemporary supermarket will be able to 
share the poet’s feelings about food, if nothing else. 

Hilaly, accused of “using a sword to sever a thread,” said: 
“Shall I rather use honey to drown a camel?” 

There are imitation Sufis, who try to benefit from the 
prestige which attaches to the name. Some of them have 
written books, which only add to a general perplexity among 
outsiders. 

It is possible that much of the Sufic spirit may be trans¬ 
mitted in writing, if one accepts the fact that Sufism has to 
be experienced continually as well as tested vicariously. It 
does not depend upon the impact only of artistic forms, but 
of life upon life. 

Sufism, in one definition, is human life. Occult and meta- 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 23 

physical powers are largely incidental, though they may 
play their part in the process, if not in personal prominence 
or satisfaction. It is axiomatic that the attempt to become a 
Sufi through a desire for personal power as normally under¬ 
stood will not succeed. Only the search for truth is valid, 
the desire for wisdom the motive. The method is assimila¬ 
tion, not study. 

In observing the Sufis by means of what are in fact deri¬ 
vations of Sufi techniques, we shall have to look at many 
things which may be important at first, but which will cease 
to have the same significance as we proceed. This technique 
can easily be illustrated. A child learns to read by master¬ 
ing the alphabet When he can read words he retains the 
knowledge of the letters, but reads whole words. If he were 
to concentrate upon letters, he would be severely handi¬ 
capped by what was useful only at an earlier stage. Both 
words and letters should now have a more settled perspec¬ 
tive. Thus the Sufic method. 

The process is easier than it sounds, even if only because 
doing a thing may often be easier than describing it. 

I report a glimpse of Sufis in a circle Qialka), the basic 
unit and very heart of active Sufism. A group of seekers is 
attracted to a teaching master, and attends his Thursday 
evening assembly. The first part of the proceedings is the 
less formal time, when questions are asked, and students 
received. 

On this occasion, a newcomer had just asked our teacher, 
the Agha, whether there was a basic urge toward mystical 
experience, shared by all humanity. 

“We have a word,” replied the Agha, “which sums all this 
up. It describes what we are doing, and it summarizes our 
way of thinking. Through it you will understand the very 
reason for our existence, and the reason why mankind is 
generally speaking at odds. The word is Anguruzuminab- 
stafil” And he explained it in a traditional Sufi story. 

Four men—a Persian, a Turk, an Arab, and a Greek— 
were standing in a village street. They were traveling com- 



THE SUFIS 


24 

panions, mating for some distant place; but at this moment 
they were arguing over the spending of a single piece of 
money which was all that they had among them. 

“I want to buy angur” said the Persian. 

“I want uzum” said the Turk. 

“X want inab,” said the Arab. 

“No!” said the Greek, “we should buy stafil” 

Another traveler passing, a linguist, said, “Give the coin 
to me. I undertake to satisfy the desires of all of you.” 

At first they would not trust him. Ultimately they let him 
have the coin. He went to the shop of a fruit seller 
and bought four small bunches of grapes. 

“This is my angur,” said the Persian. 

“But this is what I call uzum,” said the Turk. 

“You have brought me inab” said the Arab. 

“No!” said the Greek, “this in my language is stafil” 

The grapes were shared out among them, and each 
realized that the disharmony had been due to his faulty 
understanding of the language of the others. 

'The travelers,” said the Agha, “are the ordinary people 
of the world. The linguist is the Sufi. People know that 
they want something, because there is an inner need exist¬ 
ing in them. They may give it different names, but it is the 
same thing. Those who call it religion have different names 
for it, and even different ideas as to what it might be. Those 
who call it ambition try to find its scope in different ways. 
But it is only when a linguist appears, someone who knows 
what they really mean, that they can stop the struggling 
and get on with the eating of the grapes.” 

The group of travelers which he had been describing, 
he continued, were more advanced than most, in that they 
actu ally had a positive idea of what they wanted, even 
though they could not communicate it. It is far more com¬ 
mon for the individual to be at an earlier stage of aspiration 
than he thinks. He wants something but does not know 
what it is—though he may think that he knows. 

The Sufic way of thinking is particularly appropriate in 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 25 

a world of mass communication, when every effort is di¬ 
rected toward making people believe that they want or need 
certain things; that they should believe certain things; that 
they should as a consequence do certain things that their 
manipulators want them to do. 

The Sufi speaks of wine, the product of the grape, and its 
secret potential, as his means of attaining “inebriationThe 
grape is seen as the raw form of the wine. Grapes, then, 
mean ordinary religion; while wine is the real essence of 
the fruit. The travelers are therefore seen to be four ordi¬ 
nary people, differing in religion. The Sufi shows them that 
the basis of their religions is in fact the same. He does not, 
however, offer them wine, the essence, which is the inner 
doctrine waiting to be produced and used in mysticism, a 
field far more developed than mere organized religion. That 
is a further stage. But the Sufi's role as a servant of hu¬ 
manity is brought out by the fact that, although he is operat¬ 
ing on a higher level, he helps the formal religionist as far 
as he can, by showing him the fundamental identity of 
religious faith. He might, of course, have gone on to a dis¬ 
cussion of the merits of wine; but what the travelers wanted 
was grapes, and grapes they were given. When the wran¬ 
gling over smaller issues subsides, according to the Sufi, the 
greater teaching may be imparted. Meanwhile, some sort of 
primary lesson has been given. 

The basic urge toward mysticism is never, in the unaltered 
man, clear enough to be recognized for what it is. 

Rumi, in his version of this story ( Mathnawi, Bk. II) al¬ 
ludes to the Sufi training system when he says that the 
grapes, pressed together, produce one juice—the wine of 
Sufism. 

The Sufis often start from a nonreligious viewpoint . 6 The 
answer, they say, is within the mind of mankind. It has to be 
liberated, so that by self-knowledge the intuition becomes 
the guide to human fulfillment. The other way, the way of 

8 "Words cannot be used in referring to religious truth, except as 
analogy. ^Halcim Sanai, The Walled Garden of Truth .) 


THE SUFIS 


26 

training, suppresses and stills the intuition. Humanity is 
turned into a conditioned animal by nori-Sufi systems, while 
being told that it is free and creative, has a choice of thought 
and action. 

The Sufi is an individual who believes that by practicing 
alternate detachment and identification with life, he be¬ 
comes free. He is a mystic because he believes that he can 
become attuned to the purpose of all life. He is a practical 
man because he believes that this process must take place 
within normal society. And he must serve humanity because 
he is a part of it. The great El-Tughrai, contemporary of 
Omar Khayyam, wrote this warning in mi A.D.: “O Man, 
that art so full of information penetrating into secrets; listen, 
for in silence is safety from slips—They have fostered thee 
for a purpose, did thou but understand it. Have a care to 
thyself, lest thou feed with lost sheep/" This was translated 
by Edward Pococke in 1661. 

In order to succeed in this endeavor, he must follow the 
methods which have been devised by earlier masters, methods 
for slipping through the complex of training which makes 
most people prisoners of their environment and of the effect 
of their experiences. The exercises of the Sufis have been 
developed through the interaction of two things—intuition 
and the changing aspects of human life. Different methods 
will suggest themselves intuitively in different societies and 
at various times. This is not inconsistent, because real intui¬ 
tion is itself always consistent. 

The Sufi life can be lived at any time, in any place. It 
does not require withdrawal from the world, or organized 
movements, or dogma. It is coterminous with the existence 
of humanity. It cannot, therefore, accurately be termed an 
Eastern system. It has profoundly influenced both the East 
and the very bases of the Western civilization in which 
many of us live—the mixture of Christian, Jewish, Moslem 
and Near Eastern or Mediterranean heritage commonly 
called ‘Western." 

Mankind, according to the Sufis, is infinitely perfectable. 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 27 

The perfection comes about through attunement with the 
whole of existence. Physical and spiritual life meet, but only 
when there is a complete balance between them. Systems 
which teach withdrawal from the world are regarded as 
unbalanced. 

Physical exercises are linfced with theoretical patterns. In 
Sufi psychology there is an important relationship between, 
for instance, the doctrine of the “Seven Stages of Man” 7 
and the integration of personality; and between movement, 
experience and the progressive attainment of a higher 
personality. 

When, and where, did the Sufi way of thinking start? 
This is, to most Sufis, slightly irrelevant to the work at hand. 
The “place” of Sufism is within humanity. The “place” of 
your sitting-room carpet is on the floor of your house—not 
in Mongolia, where its design may have originated. 

“The practice of the Sufis is too sublime to have a formal 
beginning,” says the Asrar el Qadim wa’l Qadim (Secrets 
of the Past and Future). But as long as one remembers that 
history is less important than the present and the future, 
there is a great deal to be learned from a review of the spread 
of the modem Sufi trend since it branched out from the 
areas which were Arabized nearly fourteen hundred years 
ago. By a glance at this period of development, the Sufis 
show how and why the message of self-perfection may 
be carried into every conceivable kind of society, irrespec¬ 
tive of its nominal religious or social commitment 

Sufism is believed by its followers to be the inner, “secret” 
teaching that is concealed within every religion; and because 
its bases are in every human mind already, Sufic develop¬ 
ment must inevitably find its expression everywhere. The 
historical period of the teaching starts with the explosion of 
Islam from the desert into the static societies of the Near 
East

THE SUFIS 


Toward the middle of the seventh century, the expansion 
of Islam beyond the borders of Arabia was challenging, and 
was soon to overthrow, the empires of the Middle East. Each 
one had a venerable tradition in the political, military and 
religious spheres. The armies of Islam, originally composed 
mainly of Bedouins, but then swollen by recruits of other 
origins, struck northward, eastward and to the west. The 
Caliphs fell heir to the lands of the Hebrews, the Byzan¬ 
tines, the Persians and the Graeco-Buddhists; the conquerors 
reached the south of France in the West, and the valley of 
the Indus in the East. Those political, military and reli¬ 
gious conquests form the nucleus of the Moslem countries 
and communities of today, which extend from Indonesia in 
the Pacific to Morocco on the Atlantic. 

It is from this background that the Sufi mystics became 
known in the West, and they maintained a current of teach¬ 
ing which links people of intuition from the Far East to 
the farthest West 

The early Caliphs had possessed themselves of more than 
millions of square miles, uncounted riches and the political 
supremacy of the known world of the middle ages. The 
centers of learning of the ancients, and particularly the 
traditional schools of mystical teaching, had almost all fallen 
into their hands. In Africa, the ancient communities of 
Egypt, including Alexandria; and farther west, Carthage, 
where St. Augustine had studied and preached esoteric, pre- 
Christian doctrines. 8 Palestine and Syria, the homes of 
secret traditions; Central Asia, where the Buddhists were 
most firmly entrenched; and northwest India with its vener¬ 
able background of mysticism and experiential religion—all 
were within the empire of Islam. 

To these centers traveled the Arab mystics, anciently 
known as the Near Ones ( [muqanribun ), who believed that 
essentially there was a unity among the inner teachings of 
all faiths. Like John the Baptist, they wore camels* wool, 

8 See annotation "St. Augustine." 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 29 

and may have been known as Sufis (People of Wool), 
though not for this reason alone. As a result of these con¬ 
tacts with the Hanifs 9 each one of the ancient centers of 
secret teaching became a Sufi stronghold. The gap between 
the secret lore and practice of Christians, Zoroastrians, 
Hebrews, Hindus, Buddhists and the rest had been 
bridged* This process, the confluence of essences, has never 
been grasped by non-Sufis as a reality, because such ob¬ 
servers find it impossible to realize that the Sufi sees and 
contacts the Sufic stream in every culture, as a bee will suck 
from many flowers without becoming a flower. Even the 
Sufic usage of “confluence” terminology to denote this func¬ 
tion has not penetrated far. 10 

Sufi mysticism differs tremendously from other cults claim¬ 
ing to be mystical. Formal religion is for the Sufi merely a 
shell, though a genuine one, which fulfills a function. When 
the human consciousness has penetrated beyond this social 
framework, the Sufi understands the real meaning of reli¬ 
gion. The mystics of other persuasions do not think in this 
manner at all. They may transcend outer religious forms, 
but they do not emphasize the fact that outer religion is 
only a prelude to special experience. Most ecstatics remain 
attached to a rapturous symbolization of some concept de¬ 
rived from their religion. The Sufi uses religion and psychol- 
ogy to pass beyond all this. Having done so, he “returns to 
the world,” to guide others on the way. 

Professor Nicholson emphasizes this vision of religion from 
an objective viewpoint, in translating Rumi thus: 11 

If there be any lover in the world, O Moslems, ’tis I. 

If there be any believer, or Christian hermit, ’tis I. 

The wine dregs, the cupbearer, the minstrel, the harp, and 
the music,

The beloved, the candle, the drink and the joy of the 
drunken—tis I. 

The two-and-seventy creeds and sects in the world 
Do not really exist: I swear by God that every creed and 
sect—'tis I. 

Earth and air and water and fire, nay, body and soul too— 
’tis L 

Truth and falsehood, good and evil, ease and difficulty from 
first to last, 

Knowledge and learning and asceticism and piety and faith 
—'tis I. 

The fire of Hell, be assured, with its flaming limbos, 

Yes, and Paradise and Eden and the Houris—'tis L 
This earth and heaven with all they hold, 

Angels, Peris, Genies and Mankind—'tis I. 

Rumi has broken through the limitations of the ordinary 
consciousness. Now he is able to see things as they really 
are, to understand the affinity and unity of seemingly dif¬ 
ferent things, to perceive the role of man, and especially of 
the Sufi. This is something far more advanced than what 
is ordinarily called mysticism. 

It was not always safe, in the face of vast numbers of 
enthusiastic and victorious Moslem zealots, to claim, as the 
Sufis did, that human realization came only from within 
and not through just doing certain things and not doing 
certain other things. At the same time, the Sufic attitude 
was that mysticism must be taken out of its utterly secret 
character if it were to become a force which would pene¬ 
trate all humanity. 

In their own tradition, the Sufis saw themselves as in¬ 
heritors of one single teaching—elsewhere split into so many 
facets—which could be made to serve as the instrument 
of human development. “Before garden, vine or grape was 
in the world," writes one, “our soul was drunken with im¬ 
mortal wine." 

The groundwork for the wide diffusion of Sufic thought 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 31 

and action was laid by the masters of the classical period— 
which may be taken as the first eight hundred years after 
the appearance of Islam—between about 700 A.D. and 
1500 A.D. Sufism was based upon love, operated through a 
dynamic of love, had its manifestation through ordinary 
human life, poetry and work. 

Because the Sufis recognized Islam as a manifestation of 
the essential upsurge of transcendental teaching, there could 
be no interior conflict between Islam and Sufism. Sufism 
was taken to correspond to the inner reality of Islam, as 
with the equivalent aspect of every other religion and 
genuine tradition. 

The great Sufi Khayyam, in his Rubaiyat, stresses this 
interior experience, which has no real connection with the 
theological version of what people consider, by default, to 
be real religion: 

In cell and cloister, monastery and synagogue, one lies 

In dread of hell: one dreams of paradise. 

But none that know the divine secrets 

Has sown his heart with suchlike fantasies. 

The phase into which what we call Sufism now entered 
was different in respect of climate and environment, but 
identical in respect of continuity of teaching. Rigid ec¬ 
clesiastics—formalists—might not have recognized this, but 
they were relatively unimportant—“He who can see all the 
picture can both understand it and cater for it." Professor 
E. G. Browne comments: “But even the genuine Sufis dif¬ 
fered considerably one from another for their system was es¬ 
sentially individualistic and little disposed towards propa- 
gandism. The fully developed or if, gnostic, or Adept, had 
passed through many grades and a long course of discipline 
under various pits, murshids, or spiritual directors, ere he 
attained to the gnosis (irfan) which viewed all existing 
religions as more or less faint utterances of that great under¬ 
lying Truth with which he had finally entered into com¬ 
munion; and he neither conceived it as possible nor desir-

able to impart his conceptions of this Truth to any save 
those few who, by a similar training, were prepared to re¬ 
ceive it" 12 

It is sometimes difficult for a conventionally minded per¬ 
son to grasp how far-reaching the rule of essential Sufic 
action re all y is. Since Sufism was bound to exist in Islam as 
elsewhere, it could easily be taught through Islam. It is 
instructive to note that two legalistic and theological com¬ 
pendia, obviously straining to present Sufism publicly as 
religiously orthodox, were written by Sufi giants—the T aaruf 
of Kalabadhi of Bokhara (died 995) and the first public 
Persian treatise, the Kcishf of Hujwiri (died 1063). Both 
authors are of the highest Sufi rank, yet each often speaks as 
if he were an observer, not an initiate, as Omar Khayyam 
also frequently does, to the mystification of some of his trust¬ 
ingly literalist commentators. These authors are full of hid¬ 
den meanings, never reproduced in translation, and it was 
precisely in this way that many of the Orders of medieval 
Sufism proceeded. They continued their work, which was 
entirely valid within the Islamic world. Yet, as some Sufis 
note, “Sufism was even taught at one time exclusively by 
signs.” The end product, the Completed Man, is the same in 
both cases. The symbolism and chain of experience whereby 
Islam and other systems are reconciled through Sufi practice 
is another matter, vouchsafed only to practitioners and con¬ 
cealed in the dictum: “He who tastes, knows.” 

Although many explanations are given—for various rea¬ 
sons—for the adoption of the word “Sufi,” there is one 
significant one which is taught to those who join these 
mystics—the word contains, in enciphered form, the concept 
of Love. Also encoded, this time by means of a conventional 
numerical cipher, are the following words, which convey 
an abbreviated message-above; transcending; correcting; a 
bequest; sufficiency in or at a reasonable time. Sufism, then, 
is a transcendental philosophy, which corrects, is handed 

12 E. G. Browne, A Literary History of Persia, 1909, p. 424*

down from the past, and is suitable to the contemporary 
community. 

All religion is subject to development. To the Sufi, the 
evolution of the Sufi is within himself and also in his rela¬ 
tionship with society. The development of the community, 
and the destiny of all creation—including even nominally 
inanimate creation—is interwoven with the destiny of the 
Sufi. He may have to detach himself for a period from society 
—for a moment, a month, or even more—but ultimately he 
is interlinked with the eternal whole. The Sufi’s impor¬ 
tance, therefore, is immense, and his actions and appearance 
to others will seem to vary in accordance with human and 
extrahuman needs. Jalaluddin Rumi emphasizes the evolu¬ 
tionary nature of human effort, which is true both in the 
individual and the group: “I died as inert matter and became 
a plant. And as a plant I died and became an animal. I 
died as an animal, and became a man. So why should I fear 
losing my ‘human’ character? I shall die as a man, to rise in 
‘angelic’ form. . . .” (Mathfiawi, HI, Story XVII) 

This attitude explains in a Sufic manner something of the 
seeming differences in conduct and attitude of the Sufis. 
Keeping pace with the realities of the community, the Sufis 
of the early Islamic period stressed the need for renunciation 
and discipline—factors which were very much lacking in the 
expanding and prosperous society which was forming on the 
basis of military success in the Near East. The ordinary 
historians fail to note this fact, and consequently look at 
the Sufis historically, believing that they can descry an in¬ 
dependent development within the ranks of the devotees. 
Rabia, the woman Sufi saint, for instance (died 802), is said 
to have emphasized love; Nuri (died 907), shunning the 
world. Then, we are told, came a further departure, with a 
more involved view of life—speculative and philosophical. 
And much more, a following of supposed trends from with¬ 
out the cult. 

This development is undoubtedly a fact, but its explana¬ 
tion is, according to the Sufi, very much unlike its superficial 



THE SUEIS 


34 

appearance. In the first place, the elements of Sufism were 
always there in their entirety, within the human mind. Vari¬ 
ous forms of the teaching were stressed at different times— 
“No man spends all his time enraged.” 

Individuals like Rabia were chosen as exemplars of cer¬ 
tain aspects of the teaching. Uninitiated readers of the rec¬ 
ords, deprived of the necessary contextual framework, have 
quite naturally assumed that such and such a Sufi spent all 
his time in self-mortification; that before, say, Bayazid 
(died 875) there was no similarity to Vedantism and Bud¬ 
dhism, and so on. Perhaps these conclusions were in¬ 
evitable, given the poverty of materials available to the 
ordinary student. On the other hand, there must always 
have been many Sufis who were willing to explain this 
point; to them, naturally, a generally known one. But it is 
inherent in scholastic thinking that something written down 
has a greater validity than something said or experienced; 
and it is thus more than likely that the living representa¬ 
tives of Sufism have been but rarely consulted on these 
points by academicians. 

The recognition of the climate established by Islam as a 
suitable one for projecting Sufi wisdom is easy to trace. In 
spite of the development of an unauthorized clergy in 
Islam, those narrow-minded scripturists who stuck to a 
dogmatic interpretation of the religion, Islam provided bet¬ 
ter conditions for propagating an inner doctrine than any of 
its precursors in the same area. Religious minorities were 
guaranteed freedom from persecution—an immunity which 
was rigidly adhered to during the period when the Sufis 
were becoming visibly active. Islam itself was a matter of 
legal definition. What was a believer? At the minimum, a 
person who would repeat the phrase J^Jlfaha-illa-Allcih, 
Mohammed ar-Rasul-Albh —Nothing worshiped but the 
divinity, the Praised one the messenger of the worshipful” 
—which is generally understood as, “There is no God 
but Allah, and Mohammed is His Prophet.” The unbeliever 
was a person who actively denied the words of this creed. 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 35 

Nobody could see into the heart; so belief could not be de¬ 
fined, only inferred. 

Provided that a person could assert that he subscribed to 
this formula, he could not be proceeded against for heresy. 
No dogma as to the nature of this divinity and the relation¬ 
ship with the Prophet was fixed; and there was nothing in 
the phrase of affirmation which could not be subscribed to 
by a Sufi. His interpretation might be more mystical than 
that of the scholastics, but no power existed, no ordained 
priesthood, for instance, which could finally establish the 
ascendancy of the clerics. Ultimately, Islam as a community 
was regulated by the interpretations of the doctors of law. 
They could not define Allah, who was beyond human def¬ 
inition, nor could they precisely interpret Messengership, a 
unique relationship of deity and man. Before very long, Sufis 
were able freely to say such things as: “I am an idol wor¬ 
shiper; for I understand what idol worship means, and 
the idolator does not.” 

The breakup of the old order in the Near East, according 
to Sufi tradition, reunited the “beads of mercury” which were 
the esoteric schools operating in the Egyptian, Persian and 
Byzantine empires into the “stream of quicksilver” which was 
intrinsic, evolutionary Sufism. 

The Sufis even established the principle, often to be ac¬ 
cepted by Islamic courts of law, that seemingly irreverent 
statements made in a state of mystical ecstasy could not be 
taken at their face value for penal purposes. “If a bush can 
say, Tl am Truth/ ” said a famous Sufi, “so can a man.” 

There was, too, a well-established belief among the gen¬ 
eral public that Mohammed had had a special relationship 
with other mystics, and that the devout and highly respected 
“Seekers of Truth” 18 who surrounded him during his life¬ 
time might have been the recipients of an inner doctrine 
which he imparted in private. Mohammed, it will be remem¬ 
bered, did not claim to bring any new religion. He was 

18 Tulab el Haqq .

continuing the monotheistic tradition which he stated was 
working long before his time. He inculcated respect for 
members of other faiths, and spoke of the importance of 
spiritual teachers of many kinds. The Koran itself was re¬ 
vealed by mystical methods, and provided many indications 
of mystical thinking. 

In the religious sphere, the Koran maintains the unity of 
religions and the identical origin of each—'Every nation 
had a Warner" Islam accepted Moses, Jesus and others as 
inspired prophets. Further, the recognition of Mohammed’s 
mission by numerous former Jews, Christians and Magians 
(including priests), some of whom had traveled to Arabia 
during his lifetime seeking a teacher, provided a further 
basis for the belief in a continuity of ancient, not localized, 
teaching, of which previous highly organized religions might 
be merely elaborations or popularizations. 

This is why, in Sufi tradition, the “Chain of Transmission" 
of Sufi schools may reach back to the Prophet by one line, 
and to Elias by another. One of the most respected seventh- 
century Sufi masters—Uways, who died in 657—never met 
Mohammed, though he was living in Arabia at the same 
time and outlived him. Again, it is authoritatively on record 
that the name “Sufi" was in use before the declaration of his 
prophetic mission by Mohammed. 14 It is essential to grasp 
this sense of continuity of inner teaching, and also the be¬ 
lief in the evolution of society, if the Sufis are to be under¬ 
stood to any real extent 

But perhaps the greatest contribution of Islam to the 
spread of Sufic thinking was its lack of exdusivism and its 
acceptance of the theory that civilization was evolutionary, 
even organic. Islam, unlike any of its predecessors, insisted 
that truth became available to all peoples at specific times 
in their development; and that Islam, far from being a new 
religion, was no more and no less than the last in the chain 
of great religions addressed to the peoples of the world. In 


14 Kitab el-humcu 



THE TRAVELERS AND THE GRAPES 37 

stating that there would be no prophet after Mohammed, 
Islam in its sociological sense reflected the human conscious¬ 
ness that the age of the rise of new theocratic systems was 
at an end. The events of the succeeding fifteen hundred 
years have shown this to be only too true. It is, for reasons 
of the development of society as we have it today, incon¬ 
ceivable that new religious teachers of the caliber of the 
founders of world religions should attain any prominence 
comparable to that achieved by Zoroaster, Buddha, Moses, 
Jesus, and Mohammed. 

After the full development of the Islamic civilization in 
the middle ages, the contact between the indwelling other¬ 
worldliness streams of all peoples was to attain a far greater 
closeness than during the legendary days when practical 
mysticism was confined to relatively small, very secretive 
groups. Now Sufism began to spread in a number of dif¬ 
ferent ways. The teachers who specialized in concentration 
and contemplation counteracted the greater trend toward 
materiality by balancing materialism with asceticism. Ascet¬ 
icism, warned the great Sufi Hasan of Basra (died 728), can 
be masochistic, in which case its use is due to a lack of forti¬ 
tude. Every Sufi had to go through a period of training- 
long or short according to his capacity—before he could be 
considered sufficiently balanced to be “in the world but yet 
not of it.” Adapting their teachings to the needs of society, 
Sufi poets and singers created masterpieces which were to 
become a part of the classical heritage of the East. In circles 
where entertainment and frivolity prevailed, the Sufi tech¬ 
niques adjusted themselves in music and dance, in teaching 
through romantic and wonderful tales, and especially in 
humor. The concentration on the theme of love, and the 
separation of the human being from his goal, was early in¬ 
troduced into military spheres, where chivalry and the theme 
of the quest of the beloved and of an ultimate fulfillment 
produced further literature and the formation of chivalric 
orders, subsequently significant in East and West.

With the expansion of science and the arts in medieval 
Saracendom, the Sufi genius asserted itself when Sufis be¬ 
came physicians and scientists, and left symbols in their 
buildings and decorative art (some of them are nowadays 
called arabesques) which were designed to maintain in 
visible form certain eternal truths believed by the Sufis to 
summarize the human soul in search of, and in progress 
toward, final harmony and integration with all creation. 1 

The results of the intensely practical system of the Sufis, 
though often obscure to outsiders through ignorance of the 
system's real meaning, are to be found throughout the think¬ 
ing, the art and the magico-occult phenomena of the East 
and West alike. Approaching closer to the Sufic experience, 
we must glimpse the methods of thinking and the basic ideas

one thousand years before Einstein, the dervish Hujwiri was in tech¬ 
nical literature discussing the identity of time and space in applied 
Sufi experience. (Revelation of the Veiled, "Recapitulation of Their 
Miracles") 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 39 

of these mystics. We could start with a poem, a joke, a 
symbol. 

The pathways into Sufic thinking are, it is traditionally 
said, almost as varied as the number of Sufis in existence. 
Religion, for instance, cannot be accepted or rejected out of 
hand, until the student knows exactly what religion means. 
The essential unity of all religious faith is not agreed on 
throughout the world, say the Sufis, because most of the 
believers are not at all aware as to what religion itself essen¬ 
tially is. It does not have to be what it is generally assumed 
to be. 

To the Sufi, the religionist and scoffer are like a believer 
in the flatness of the earth arguing with one who holds that 
it is cylindrical in shape—neither has any real experience of 
it. 

This brings out a fundamental difference between the 
method of the Sufis and that of other metaphysical systems. 
It is too often taken for granted that a person must either 
be a believer or an unbeliever, or perhaps an agnostic. If a 
believer, he will expect to be offered a faith or a system 
which seems to him to fulfill what he thinks are his needs. 
Few people tell him that he may not understand what his 
needs are. 

The Sufi's world has extra dimensions; to him things are 
meaningful in a sense which they are not to people who 
follow only the training which is imposed upon them by 
ordinary society. 

Such people "squint." "A hungry man, asked to total two 
and two, will answer, Tour (or even eight) loaves of 
bread,!* 

The totality of life cannot be understood, so runs Sufi 
teaching, if it is studied only through the methods which 
we use in everyday living. This is partly because, although 
the question, "What is it all about?" can of course be posed 
in a nominally reasonable sequence of words, the answer is 
not to be expressed in a similar way. It comes through ex¬ 
perience, and enlightenment. An instrument which can as-

sess a small thing cannot necessarily assess a large thing. 
“Practice your knowledge, for knowledge without practice is 
a body without life,"—Abu Hanifa. 2 A scientist may tell 
you that space and time are the same thing, or that matter is 
not solid at all. He may be able to prove it by his own 
methods. This, however, will make little difference to your 
understanding, and none at all to your experience, of what 
all this involves. All matter is infinitely divisible, shall we 
say. But for most practical purposes there is a limit to the 
number of divisions which you can make of a piece of choco¬ 
late if it is still to function as you expect a piece of choco¬ 
late to function. So on the one hand you may he looking at 
a piece of chocolate, on the other an object which you want 
to divide into as many pieces as possible. The human mind 
tends to generalize from partial evidence. The Sufis believe 
that they can experience something more complete, 

A traditional Sufi story illuminates this question in one of 
its aspects, and shows the difficulties which beset even 
scholars when they approach the Sufis with a view to under¬ 
standing them by applying limited methods of study: 

An elephant belonging to a traveling exhibition had been 
stabled near a town where no elephant had been seen before. 
Four curious citizens, hearing of the hidden wonder, went 
to see if they could get a preview of it. When they arrived at 
the stable they found that there was no light The investiga¬ 
tion therefore had to be carried out in the dark. 

One, touching its trunk, thought that the creature must 
resemble a hosepipe; the second felt an ear and concluded 
that it was a fan. The third, feeling a leg, could liken it only 
to a living pillar; and when the fourth put his hand on its 
back he was convinced that it was some kind of throne. 
None could form the complete picture; and of the part 

2 Abu Hanifa is the founder of one of the four great Islamic schools 
of law, the Fourth School. He was the Sufi teacher of Daud of Tai 
(died 781]). Daud passed on his teachings to his disciple Maaruf 
Karkhi (“Solomon the King”) the founder of the Sufi fraternity 
called "The Builders.” 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 41 

which each felt, he could only refer to it in terms of things 
which he already knew. The result of the expedition was 
confusion. Each was sure that he was right; none of the 
other townspeople could understand what had happened, 
what the investigators had actually experienced. 

The average person, wanting to inform himself as to what 
the Sufis' thinking is, will normally address himself to ref¬ 
erence books. He may look up the word “Sufi” in an ency¬ 
clopaedia, or have recourse to books by scholars of various 
kinds, experts in religion and mysticism. 

If he does so, he will find a most admirable example of the 
“elephant in the dark” mentality. 

According to one Persian scholar, Sufism is a Christian 
aberration. A professor at Oxford thinks that it is influenced 
by the Hindu Vedanta. An Arab-American professor speaks 
of it as a reaction against intellectualism in Islam. A profes¬ 
sor of Semitic literature claims traces of Central Asian 
Shamanism. A German will have us find in it Christianity 
plus Buddhism. Two very great English Orientalists put 
their money on a strong Neoplatonic influence; yet, one of 
them will concede that it was perhaps independently gen¬ 
erated. An Arab, publishing his opinions through an Amer¬ 
ican university, assures his readers that Neoplatonism 
(which he invokes as a Sufic ingredient) is itself Greek plus 
Persian. One of the greatest Spanish Arabists, while claim¬ 
ing an initiation of Christian monastidsm, plumps for 
Manichaeism as a Sufi source. Another academician of no 
less repute finds Gnosticism among the Sufis; while the Eng¬ 
lish professor who is the translator of a Sufistic book prefers 
to think of it as “a little Persian sect.” But another translator 
finds the mystical tradition of the Sufis “in the Koran itself.” 
“Although the numerous definitions of Sufism which occur 
in Arabic and Persian books on the subject are historically 
interesting, their chief importance lies in showing that 
Sufism is undefinable.” 3

THE SUFIS 


42 

A Pakistani view of Rumi (1207-1273) considers him the 
heir of virtually all the great currents of ancient thought as 
represented in the Near East. To those who have been in 
real contact with Sufis and who have attended their meet¬ 
ings, no mental adjustment or effort of will is needed to con¬ 
sider Sufism as containing within itself the myriad threads 
which appear in such non-Sufi systems as Gnosticism, Neo¬ 
platonism, Aristotelianism, and so on. "Numberless waves, 
lapping and momentarily reflecting the sun—all from the 
same sea,” says the master Halid. The mind which has on 
the other hand been coached to believe in the distinctiveness 
or monopoly of ideas of certain schools will not easily be 
able to bring this synthesizing understanding into the con¬ 
templation of Sufism. 

Dr. Khalifa Abdu-Haldm shows that he is able to refer to 
all the philosophical schools whose ideas are shared with 
Rumi, without being compelled to consider one as derived 
from the other. He says: "His Mathnawi is a crystal of many 
facets. In it we see reflected the broken lights of Semitic 
monotheism, Greek intellectualism, Plato's theory of ideas 
and Aristotle's theory of causation and development, the One 
of Plotinus and the ecstasy that unites with the One, the 
controversial questions of the mutakdlimun (Schoolmen), 
the Erkenntnistheoretisch problems of Ibn Sina and al- 
Farabi, Ghazali's theory of Prophetic Consciousness and Ibn 
El-Arabi's monism.” 

Which does not mean to imply, if my position is not yet 
clear, that Rumi has concocted a system of mysticism out of 
the above ingredients. "Pears are not found only in 
Samarkand.” 

The world literature on Sufism is large—a great number 
of Sufi texts have been translated by Western scholars. Few, 
if any, have had the advantage of experiencing Sufism, or 
knowing its oral lore or even the order in which its formal 
material is studied. This is not to say that their labors have 
not been very much worthwhile. They have been most use¬ 
ful to the Orientalist, but may tend to be incoherent. Like 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 


43 

the legendary scribe who had to accompany his letter and 
read it himself because of its illegibility, many of these works 
need a Sufi's commentary. 

The effect of the translations and discursive books on 
Sufism upon the uninitiated student must be remarkable, 
and certainly will not be easily forgotten. The method of 
approaching the question of translations has its quaint¬ 
nesses. Setting aside the matter of differences between trans¬ 
lators in matters of accuracy and meaning (which have 
caused much feline though really irrelevant activity 
among them), we find that the literary material offered the 
captive reader in translated form may undergo strange ad¬ 
ventures. 

Sometimes attempts are made to reproduce in English 
the cadence or the original rhymes of Eastern poetry, be¬ 
cause the translator feels that this device helps to convey 
the sense of the original. But other translators hold the op¬ 
posite view, and eschew any attempt to reproduce meter, 
because they claim that it is impossible of attainment or 
otherwise undesirable. Some texts, again, are translated with 
the aid of non-Sufi (generally Moslem, even formal 
Christian theological) commentaries. Then there are the 
partial translations, selectively presented, having suffered 
excisions which the translator somehow considers himself en¬ 
titled to make. The less he knows about the practices of the 
Sufi, the braver these mutilations seem to be. Yet Sufi writ¬ 
ings are never solely literary, philosophical or technical 
material. 

There is a translation of a Persian book into English, not 
from Persian, but from a French translation of an Urdu 
rendering of a classical Persian abridgment of an Arabic 
original. There are modem versions of Persian classics, 
sometimes edited to remove references offensive to current 
Iranian religious beliefs. Add to these the works of Christian 
(missionary), Hindu and Western neo-Hindu—and West¬ 
ern neo-Sufi—nonacademic writers and popularizers. The 
presentation of Sufism to the average literate man in a 



THE SUEIS 


44 

Western language reveals a condition o£ literature which is 
perhaps unmatched in any other field. 

This kaleidoscopic process has its own special incidental 
delights. The warping tendency, to find a term for which 
seems impossible, unless it be “polychotomy” (on the pat¬ 
tern of dichotomy) had in fact reached an amusing point 
nearly a thousand years ago. This was when the Jewish 
thinker Avicebron of Malaga (c. 1020-c. 1050 or 70) wrote 
the Fount of Life, a book based upon Sufi illuministic 
philosophy. Because he wrote in Arabic, many authoritative 
Christians of the northern European school, then imbibing 
“Arab” learning, thought that he was an Arab. Some at 
least considered that he was a Christian, “sound in doctrine,” 
and they said so. The Franciscans accepted his teachings, 
which they eagerly transmitted into the Christian stream of 
thought, having culled them from a Latin translation made 
about a century after Avicebron’s death. 

A lady of academic distinction who has written authorita¬ 
tively on Middle Eastern mysticism has felt more than one 
part of the elephant; for in one and the same book she says 
Sufism “might have been directly effected (sic) by Buddhis¬ 
tic ideas;” and that the earliest Sufis “can have had little con¬ 
tacts with Hellenistic literature of any kind”—yet their 
ideas were derived from Hellenistic sources. Then she ends 
her study of the Sufic way with the decision that “Its real 
origin and source are to be found in the agelong desire of the 
human soul for God.” 

Sufi activity has had a considerable influence upon the 
Christian West, so much so that a better than average case 
could be made out for the Sufi assertion that objective truth 
contains within it a dynamic which can hardly be gainsaid. 
This vitalistic force, however, depends for its correct expres¬ 
sion upon correct alignment of the human receptor. If this 
preparation is absent, the Sufic current is liable to take a 
peculiar turn. Especially susceptible to this warping is the 
elective or fragmentary handling of the Sufi stream. An ex- 



the elephant in the dark 45 

cellent illustration might be made from the fate of Ghazali s 
work in Europe. 

Ghazali of Central Asia (1058—1 x 11) wrote a book called 
Destruction of the Philosophers, which was soon translated 
in part and used by Catholic apologists against Moslem and 
Christian schools alike. The portion which came into the 
hands of the West, however, was only that part which was 
devoted to a preparatory exposition of philosophy. Ghazali's 
Sufi works have to be read as a whole, and his opinions 
about the value of Sufic exercises must also be followed 
if he is to be understood aright. This book, however, was an¬ 
swered by another Arab, Ibn Rushd of C6rdoba (1126- 
1198). Under the name Averroes, he, too, was translated. 
He did not succeed in refuting Ghazali at all by his scho¬ 
lastic methods, but thought that he had done so. Yet Aver- 
roism dominated Western and Christian scholastic thought 
for no less than four hundred years—from the twelfth to 
the end of the sixteenth century. Taken together, Ghazali's 
fragments and Averroes* Aristotelianism constituted a dou¬ 
ble Sufic current (action and reaction) which nurtured a 
Christendom wholly ignorant (as far as scholastics were con¬ 
cerned) of the initiating cause of both Ghazalism and 
Averroism. 

“It is necessary to note,” says Rumi, "that opposite things 
work together, even though nominally opposed.” (Fihi Ma 
Fiht) 

The fundamental Sufi awareness that Sufism is both a 
teaching and a part of an organic evolution is seldom shared 
by those who make it their concern to attempt a study of 
the system. There is consequently almost no possibility that 
the outsider will be able to form accurate conclusions. Rely¬ 
ing upon his discursive faculty alone, he is incapacitated 
before he begins. It is the externalist of today, as much as of 
yesterday, whom Rumi addresses in his Mathnawi: 

Danad o ki nekhakht wa muharam ast: 

Zirdki az Ihlis wa ishq Adam ast . 



46 THE SUFIS 

Which is to the effect that: 

He who is fortunately enlightened [the Sufi] 

Knows that sophistry is from the devil and love from Adam, 

If the Sufis confuse the scholar by their seeming incon¬ 
sistencies and sometimes cause him to hedge his conclusions 
with too many qualifications to be of great value, they can 
rouse the theologian to holy wrath. Love, an active prin¬ 
ciple of Sufic development and experience, the mechanism 
and the goal alike, cannot be admitted as genuine. The 
Reverend Professor W. R. Inge, in Christian Mysticism , 
hastens to hurl himself at what he takes to be the target: 
“The Sufis, or Mohammedan mystics, use erotic language 
very freely, and appear, like true Asiatics, to have attempted 
to give a sacramental or symbolic character to the indul¬ 
gence of their passions.” 

This classic sample conjures up visions of certain Western 
scholars who have embraced Sufism, revealing them to be 
imitation Asiatics addicted to erotic language (in secret, for 
they do not publish it) which itself covers up the indul¬ 
gence of their passions. They, in turn, might be able to 
comfort themselves with the opinion of a Cambridge pro¬ 
fessor who sees Sufism, more respectably, as “the develop¬ 
ment of the primordial religion of the Aryan race.” And if 
Sufi symbolism is not in fact such, but rather represents 
experiences actually lived, then we might well find that the 
Sufis are even more versatile than their staunchest supporters 
know. The Sufi literalist would be able to swallow a hun¬ 
dred oceans, worship idols while not worshiping them, 
travel to China in a state of drunkenness—being in the 
world and yet not of it the while—not to mention his hun¬ 
dred moons and suns. 

Advocates of a literal interpretation of mystical expres¬ 
sions are, of course, already adequately answered by such 
specialists as Evelyn Underhill: 

“Symbol—the clothing which the spiritual borrows from 
the material plane—is a form of artistic expression. That is 



the elephant in the dark 47 

to say, it is not literal but suggestive; though the artist who 
used it may sometimes lose sight of this distinction. Hence 
the persons who imagine that the ‘spiritual marriage* of St. 
Catherine or St. Teresa veils a perverted sexuality, that the 
vision of the Sacred Heart involved an incredible anatomi¬ 
cal experience or that the divine inebriation of the Sufis 
is the apotheosis of drunkenness, do but advertise their ig¬ 
norance of the mechanism of the arts: like the lady who 
thought that Blake must be mad because he said that he 
had touched the sky with his finger /* 4 

It must be admitted that it is easier for the scholar to 
approach and describe one aspect of the Elephant in the 
Dark than it is for him to form a coherent outside view of 
Sufism. Many scholars suffer from a psychological incapacity 
to handle this theme. “Apart from incapacity itself/* says 
Ghazali, “other shortcomings prevent the reaching of inner 
truth. One such is knowledge acquired by external means/* 
C Alchemy of Happiness') 

In addition to the unscalable wall of Sufi experience, 
there is the problem of the Sufi personality. Any ordinary 
survey of Sufic writings and careers would be enough to 
bewilder the least doctrinaire investigator. Among the Sufis 
have been former Zoroastrian, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist 
and other priests; Persians, Greeks and Arabs, Egyptians, 
Spaniards and Englishmen. There are in the ranks of the 
Sufi masters theologians, a reformed captain of banditti, 
slaves, soldiers, merchants, viziers, kings and artists. Only 
two are well known to many contemporary Western read¬ 
ers. They are the poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam 
of Persia, and the prince Abu ben-Adam of Afghanistan— 
the subject of a poem by Leigh Hunt: “Abu ben-Adam, 
may his tribe increase. . . /* 

Among those directly influenced by Sufism we can name 
at random Raymond Lully, Goethe, President de Gaulle, and 
Dag Hammerskjold of the United Nations.

THE SUEIS

Writing often under threat of inquisitorial persecution, 
Sufis have prepared books reconciling their practices with 
orthodoxy and defending the use of fanciful imagery. In 
order to obscure the meanings of ritualistic factors, or for 
the necessary purpose of appearing mere compilers of Sufi 
compendiums, they have handed down manuscripts from 
which the Sufic essence is to be distilled only by those who 
have the necessary equipment. Adapting their workings to 
different places, epochs and temperaments, they have in 
turn stressed the roles of asceticism, piety, music and move¬ 
ment, solitude and gregariousness. Only the respectably reli¬ 
gious of the Sufi manuals are available outside Sufi circles. 

That a person may be completely ignorant of the coher¬ 
ence behind Sufi teaching and yet appreciate the work of its 
great poets has been demonstrated again and again by 
translators. Gertrude Bell, an indefatigable student and 
translator into English of the great Hafiz, was hailed by 
the Orientalist Sir Denison Ross for her scholarship and 
judgment. Yet she is the first to admit that “Exactly on what 
grounds he [Hafiz] is appreciated in the East it is difficult 
to determine, and what his compatriots make of his teach¬ 
ing it is perhaps impossible to understand ." 5 

This makes all the more interesting her shot in the dark, 
when she tries to form some opinion as to what Hafiz really 
is getting at: “From our point of view, then, the sun of his 
philosophy seems to be that there is little of which we can 
be certain, that little must always be the object of all men’s 
desire; each of us will set out upon the search for it along 
a different road, and none will find his road easy to follow, 
each may, if he be wise, discover compensations for his toil 
by the wayside ." 6 She does not see the Sufi activity as a 
process—as the Sufis see it—but could not fail to glimpse 
die strange and wholly Sufic character of Hafiz in speak¬ 
ing of, and seeing, a panorama of human thought in what

THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 49 

is to us the present, and was of course to him the distant 
future: 

It is as if his mental eye, endowed with wonderful 
acuteness of vision, had penetrated into those provinces 
of thought which we of a later age were destined to 
inhabit . 7 

Hafiz* prescience was too evident to be missed; but it was 
also startling. She can come to no conclusion about it. 

To return to our elephant, the scholars are happily much 
less doctrinaire than the ecclesiastics. For the Sufis, both 
resemble the visitors to the elephant’s house. Is it possible 
that they have, indeed, all seen a part of the parts? The 
Sufis say, “This is not a religion; it is religion;” and, “Sufism 
is the essence of all religions.” Is there, then, among the 
Sufis and elsewhere, a tradition that there is a secret doc¬ 
trine passed down by initiation and preserved by a chain of 
succession; which might account for the outside observer 
according to his prejudice seeing almost every form of reli¬ 
gion among the writings of the Sufis? 

In order to determine this, we shall have to refer to the 
opinions of the Sufis on this point, which has generally 
been disregarded by non-Sufi students; and also follow the 
traditions of other schools, as well as the transmission in 
the middle ages and other times of a belief in an inner teach¬ 
ing beyond formalized religion. The search is by no means 
an uninteresting one. 

“Formerly,” according to the Sheikh Abu el-Hasan 
Fushanji, “being a Sufi was a reality without a name. Today 
it is a name without a reality.” This statement, taken at face 
value, is generally considered to mean that people calling 
themselves Sufis abounded, while the real pursuit of the 
Sufis was not understood. And, although this, too, might be 
an interpretation of the saying, it is here intended to clarify 
a completely different point.

THE SUFIS

The urge to trace a historical phenomenon to definite 
beginnings, so well marked in the present phase of learning, 
is undoubtedly bound up with the need of the ordinary 
mind to have a beginning and, if possible, an end for every¬ 
thing. Almost everything known to man through his ordi¬ 
nary senses has for him a beginning and an end. To know 
what something is gives a sensation of stability, a feeling of 
security. The label has been stuck on the book, now it can 
be placed on the shelf—the A to Z of something or other. 
There are various more or less accepted methods of establish¬ 
ing beginnings and endings, or creating substitutes for 
them. They may be created by concocted myths and leg¬ 
ends, which often deal with how things started and how 
they will finish. Another way is that of the Chinese emperor 
who decreed that history would start with him, and that 
all earlier books should be destroyed. A third technique is 
to assume that a certain event, located in time and perhaps 
in space, represents a beginning. This was generally the 
religious way, and it is very strongly marked in familiar 
Christianity, whose official dogma depends upon it, St. 
Augustine notwithstanding. 

The belief that a certain unique religious event brought 
about a complete change in human destiny released within 
Christendom a great force of energy, but at least two factors 
seriously limited its effect. The first was time, which in the 
event showed that there was a limit to the natural and even 
artificial expansion of Church Christianity, and a limit to 
its dynamic within its own domain. The other was a 
scholastic problem. Because the teaching of Jesus was held 
to be unique (although perhaps “foreshadowed and fore¬ 
told in prophecy”)* it was difficult to attain a spiritual per¬ 
spective which was not conditioned by this belief. Religion, 
mysticism, spirituality could not now easily be looked upon 
as a natural development or a common possession of man¬ 
kind. According to the Sufis, the main counterbalance to 
the power of formalized Christianity was the continued ex¬ 
perience of the real tradition of which it is a distortion. 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 51 

Before even the tenth century, when Islam possessed the 
most powerful culture and expanding civilization of the 
known world, the theory of a secret doctrine, a teaching 
which had been cherished from the earliest times, had made 
its way from this center of gravity to the West. The first, 
and most powerful, classical Sufi school in Europe was 
founded in Spain well over a thousand years ago . 8 The 
tradition was not, as might be thought, invented in the 
West to account for the ascendancy of the Arabized 
countries. It fitted in well enough with, and was even in¬ 
cidentally encouraged by, Islam, which view of religion 
we have noted as also that of a continuous process repre¬ 
sented in every community. It existed in the Far East, and 
it would awaken a response in the hearts of those who still 
retained memories of earlier spiritual teachings. It was, in 
part, the theory of theosophy which accounted for different 
religious manifestations among communities which, accord¬ 
ing to doctrinaire religion of another brand, should not 
exist at all. 

This sense of the unity of inner, experiential or symbolic 
religion was undoubtedly at work in the days when the peo¬ 
ples of the ancient world equated each others* gods one 
with the other—Mercury with Hermes, Hermes with Thoth 
are examples. And it is this theosophical theory which the 
Sufis considered to be their own tradition, though not 
limited to the religious domain. Hence, as the Sufi has it: 

I am in the pagan; I worship at the altar of the Jew; 

I am the idol of the Yemenite, the actual temple of 
the fire worshiper; the priest of the Magian; the inner 
reality of the cross-legged Brahmin meditating; the 
brush and the color of the artist; the suppressed, 
powerful personality of the scoffer. One does not super¬ 
sede the other—when a flame is thrown into another 
flame they join at the point of “Sameness.” You throw

THE SUEIS 


a torch at a candle, and then you say, “See! I have an¬ 
nihilated the candle's flame!" (Ishan Kaiser in Speech 
of the Sages') 

The Sufis use a new point of view in order to overcome 
the conditioning which materialistic, one-sided society has 
imposed. All philosophy has been cheapened because the 
teaching of “wisdom” has become capsulated. People end¬ 
lessly repeat truisms to one another, without really ex¬ 
periencing what they mean. If a Sufi says, “What is needed 
is a new approach,” it is by no means unlikely that everyone 
who hears him will at once agree (because the statement 
sounds significant) and will immediately forget all about it. 
The meaning of the words has not sunk in. “Take the 
wheat, not the measure in which it is contained.” (Rumi, 
Mathnawi, Bk. II) 

So important is it to free the thinking from the adhesions 
of rigid thinking that the great Rumi has started both of 
his major works with exercises in this process. In this sense 
he keeps pace with the procedure which is normally fol¬ 
lowed in Sufi teaching schools; and, though the externalist 
translators probably do not know it, two of his books are in 
fact commentaries upon the stages and states of the Sufic 
development as manifested in the flesh in a Sufi school. 

In Fihi Ma Fihi, at the very beginning, Rumi takes a 
saying of Mohammed which had passed into common 
speech and become a proverb, sagely passed from lip to lip. 
Mohammed is reported as having said, “The worst of sages 
is a visitor of princes; the best of princes is a visitor of sages.” 

Rumi points out that the inner meaning of this teaching 
is that the meaning of “visiting” depends upon the quality 
of the visitor and the visited. If a great sage visits a prince, 
it is the prince who benefits; and hence he is to be con¬ 
sidered as having himself “visited” the sage. This is very far 
from being a mere juggling with words, as some less re¬ 
flective people have supposed. 

With what amounts to shock tactics, the Mathnawi opens 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 53 

its teaching, after the celebrated “Song of the Reed,” with 
what looks like a fairy tale about a prince out hunting and 
a beautiful girl. As the audience settles down to enjoy the 
conventional story, Rumi starts to manipulate it to create 
thought in the mind and to combat the tendency to “sleep,” 
which is Sufistically taken to be the usual reaction to folk¬ 
tales. 

A prince, out hunting, saw on the road a beautiful hand¬ 
maiden. He fell in love with her, and bought her. Soon 
afterward she became ill. In desperation, the potentate of¬ 
fered his doctors anything they might desire of worldly 
goods to cure her. They were unable to do so, and the girl's 
condition became worse. The prince, utterly distraught with 
love and fear, ran to a mosque and implored divine aid. 

He saw a vision in which an ancient assured him that a 
physician would soon appear. The following day, as pre¬ 
dicted, this personage arrived. The doctor looked at the girl 
and realized that every remedy tried by the leeches had 
been useless and worse. He understood that her illness was 
concerned with her inward condition. Adopting a psycho¬ 
logical method, he asked her questions and made her talk, 
until he discovered that she was in love with a certain gold¬ 
smith of Samarkand. 

He told the prince that a cure would be effected by bring¬ 
ing the goldsmith to the girl's bedside, and he agreed. The 
goldsmith, for his own part, saw in the prince's summons 
only a recognition of his own importance in goldsmithing. 
He did not realize what his fate was to be. 

When he arrived, they were married, and the girl re¬ 
covered completely. Thus far the anodyne of the story may 
well have taken effect upon the audience, who surrender 
themselves to the delights of all being well that ends well. 

But the physician now prepared medicine for the gold¬ 
smith; a medicine which made his inner faults so evident 
that the maiden saw him as he was and started to hate him. 
He died, and the girl was able to love the prince, who was 
always intended for her. 



54 THE SUEIS 

Apart from the complicated imagery of the tale in the 
original, the teaching contains an impact at many levels. 
It is not just a matter of telling a tale with one crude moral; 
it is a commentary upon some of the processes of life. 

Hadrat-i-Paghman says of this story: "Ponder it, for unless 
you feel it through, you will be like the little child who 
wants everything right and cries when things do not seem 
to be right. You will make a prison for yourself, a prison of 
emotion. When you are in this prison, you will hurt your¬ 
self on the sharpness of the bars which you have yourself 
arranged." 

Formerly, Sufi ideas and teachings were actually lived— 
and there could be a Sufi without a name for his cult. Then 
came the modem period, in which the name exists, but the 
living of it is difficult, and has had to be adapted to the "veil¬ 
ing"—conditioning—which starts in the cradle and ends 
almost in the grave. 

Exactly how old is the word "Sufism?" There were Sufis 
at all times and in all countries, says the tradition. Sufis 
existed as such and under this name before Islam. But, if 
there was a name for the practitioner, there was no name 
for the practice. The English word "Sufism" is anglicized 
from the Latin, Sufismus; it was a Teutonic scholar who, 
as recently as 1821, coined the Latinization which is now 
almost naturalized into English, Before him there was the 
word tasawwuf —the state, practice or condition of being a 
Sufi. This may not seem an important point, but to the Sufis 
it is. It is one reason why there is no static term in use 
among Sufis for their cult. They call it a science, an art, a 
knowledge, a Way, a tribe—even by a tenth-century port¬ 
manteau term, perhaps translatable as psychoanthropology 

but they do not call it Sufism. 

Tmka-sufiyya stands for the Sufi Way; and makes a very 
good English parallel because tanka, stands for Path, as well 
as a way of doing something, and also conveys the notion 
of following a path, a line or streak—the Path of the Sufi. 
Sufism is referred to by different names in accordance with 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 


55 

the sense in which it is being discussed. Thus, ihn-al- 
mmrifat (the science of Knowing) may be found; or el- 
irfan (the gnosis); and the organized Orders or groups tend 
to be called the tanka . Similarly, the Sufi is known as the 
Seeker, the Drunken man, the enlightened one, the good, 
the Friend, the Near One, the dervish, a Fakir (humble, 
poor in spirit), or Kalandar, knower (gnostic), wise, lover, 
esoterist. Because there would be no Sufism without the 
Sufis, the word always applies to people, and cannot be 
considered as an abstract form, as, say, “philology” or “com¬ 
munism” could mean respectively the study of words or a 
theory of communalist action. Sufism, then, involves the 
body of the Sufis as well as the actual practice of their cult. 
It cannot really mean any theoretical presentation of the 
Way of the Sufis. There is no theoretical or intellectual 
Sufism; any more than there can be a Sufi movement, which 
latter is a redundancy, because all Sufic being is movement 
and a movement embracing all phenomena of a similar kind. 
There are, for instance, “Christian Sufis,” a phrase which 
could be used, and has been used, by Sufis in general. The 
Sufi is even called masihi-i-batini (esoteric Christian) in 
some connections. 

If a Sufi were to present to a conventionally cataloging 
mind certain facts about the Sufis, a mental or electrical 
computer might well wreck itself in the attempt to work 
them into some kind of system. Fortunately, however, there 
are still numbers of people who can accept information on 
various levels, and who will be able to form a pattern out of 
them. Here is a series of facts about the Sufis: 

The Sufis appear in historical times mainly within the 
pale of Islam. They have produced great theologians, poets, 
scientists. They accepted atomic theory and formulated a 
science of evolution over six hundred years before Darwin. 
They have been hailed as saints, executed and persecuted as 
heretics. They teach that there is only one underlying truth 
within everything that is called religion. 

Some have said, “I believe in nothing;” others, “I believe 



THE SUFIS 


5 6 

in everything.” Some say, “Let there be no levity among 
Sufis;” others, ‘There is no Sufi without humor.” Scholas¬ 
ticism and mysticism are opposed to one another. But the 
Sufis gave rise to, among others, a school of each. Were these 
Moslem schools? No, they were Christian, associated with 
the Augustinians and St. John of the Cross, as Professor 
Palacios and others have established. From being an Ori¬ 
ental mystic, the Sufi now appears as the antecessor of 
Catholic mystics and philosophers. Let us add a few more 
facts. The coffee which we drink was traditionally first used 
by Sufis, to heighten awareness. We wear their clothes 
(shirt, belt, trousers); we listen to their music (Andalusian, 
measured music, love songs); dance their dances (waltz, 
Morris dancing); read their stories (Dante, Robinson 
Crusoe, Chaucer, William Tell); employ their esoteric 
phrases (“moment of truth,” “human spirit,” “ideal man”); 
and play their games (cards). 9 We even belong to deriva¬ 
tions of their societies, such as Freemasonry, and certain 
chivalric orders. Such Sufic elements are examined at a later 
stage in this book. 

The monk in his cell, the Fakir on the mountaintop, the 
merchant in his shop, the king on his throne—these can he 
Sufis, but this is not Sufism. The Sufi tradition has it that 
Sufism is a leaven (“Sufism is yeast”) within all human 
society. If it has never been removed from the field of aca¬ 
demic study this is because it was never made available to 
scholasticism as a subject of investigation. Its very diversity 
prevents it from being systematized in the semipermanent 
manner which would make it static enough to investigate. 
“Sufism,” according to the Sufi, “is an adventure in living, 
necessary adventure.” 

If Sufism is an adventure, a goal of human perfection at¬ 
tained by reviewing and awakening within humanity a 
higher organ of fulfillment, completion, destiny, why is it so 
difficult to assess, to locate in time, to pin down? It is pre¬ 
cisely because Sufism is carried out in every community 

® See annotation “Tarot.” 



THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 57 

and at every time that it has such diversity—and this is one 
of its secrets. The Sufi does not need the mosque, the Arabic 
language, litanies, books of philosophy, even social stability. 
The relationship with humanity is evolutionary and adap¬ 
tive, The Sufi does not depend upon his repute of being 
able to perform magic or miracles—this is less than inci¬ 
dental, though he may have that reputation. The magico- 
religious practitioner of other systems starts from the other 
end of the scale; his reputation is built upon his miracles, 
and probably sustained by them. The Sufi has a reputation, 
but this is secondary to his work, his being as a part of the 
Sufi organism. 

The moral ascendancy, or the magnetic personality, 
which the Sufi attains is not his goal but the by-product of 
his inner attainment, the reflection of his development. 

A Sufi says: "The moth, if it could think, might well be¬ 
lieve that the candle flame is desirable because it seems to 
represent perfection. The flame is the product of the wax, 
the wick and the spark which kindles. Is the human moth 
seeking the flame or the spark itself? Observe the moth. His 
destiny, to be destroyed by the flame, is visible to you and 
hidden to him." (Tongue of the Dumb, quoting Paiseem) 

He is, of course, judged by the world at large only in the 
light of what he says and does. Supposing that he has be¬ 
come a millionaire. The outside observer, realizing that this 
man has become a millionaire since he embarked upon a 
way of life called Sufism, may look upon the phenomenon 
as a millionaire-producing process. To the Sufi in question, 
however, it is the inner realization and evolution which has 
given him his inner attainment. The money may be an out¬ 
ward reflection of it, but this is of far less account than the 
Sufic experiences. This does not mean, as many people 
would assume, that he has become a millionaire obsessed 
by mysticism, and that money has no meaning for him. Such 
a development would not be possible for a Sufi, because the 
material and the metaphysical are linked in a form best 
regarded as a continuum. He would be the kind of mil-

lionaire who is not only rich, but also completely psycho¬ 
logically integrated. It is difficult for many people to absorb 
this fundamental fact sufficiently well for it to be of any 
use to them. 

In the popular practice, current from Calcutta to Cali¬ 
fornia, the ordinary person will rise to the philosophical 
heights of repeating sagely to himself or anyone who will 
listen that “money is not everything;” or that “money does 
not bring happiness.” The very fact that such an idea can 
be voiced shows that it is rooted in a previous assumption 
that money can be considered to be in some way of tran¬ 
scendental importance. Practice shows that it is not. But the 
homespun philosopher cannot grasp why this might be. The 
penniless man’s most pressing problems seem soluble by 
money. The priest tells him that money is not a good thing. 
When he gets money he may not as a result feel fulfilled. 
And these three factors he is incapable of integrating. 

Modem psychology has done some good, where, for in¬ 
stance, it has pointed out that the urge to make money may 
be a symptom of insecurity. But it has not yet integrated 
itself; historically it is still struggling sometimes against the 
tide. The Sufi attitude starts to operate on a different basis. 
All life is struggle, says the Sufi, but the struggle must be a 
coherent one. The average man is struggling against too 
many things all at once. If a confused and incomplete per¬ 
son makes money, or becomes a professional success, he still 
remains a confused and incomplete person. 

Psychology learns as it goes along, Sufism has already 
learned; it transforms the mind from its natural and ac¬ 
quired incoherence into an instrument whereby human 
dignity and destiny may be carried a stage further. 

Freudian and Jungian psychology have not the freshness 
to the Sufi mind which they have conveyed to the West. 
Freud’s sexual arguments are noted by the Sufi Sheikh 
Ghazali in his Alchemy of Happiness (written over nine 
hundred years ago) as being standard among Moslem 
theologians. The Jungian archetypal theory did not origi-

nate with Professor Jung, but was stated by the Sufi master, 
Ibn El-Arabi—as Professor Rom Landau notes in The 
Philosophy of Ibn Ardbu (New York, Macmillan, 1959, 
p, 40 et seq.) 

Sufis of all orders are steeped in Ghazali's Alchemy of 
Happiness and Ibn El-Arabi's works, and hence they are 
familiar with these supposedly modem modes of thinking 
and their limitations. 

Sufism is not susceptible to study through psychology for 
several reasons. The most interesting of these to the West¬ 
erner will probably be that Sufism is itself a far more ad¬ 
vanced psychological system than any which has yet 
developed in the West. Neither is this psychology Eastern 
in essence, but human. It is unnecessary to affirm this fact 
without support We may mention Jung's admission that 
Western psychoanalysis is only that of a beginner compared 
to that of the East: 

“Psychoanalysis itself and the lines of thought to which 
it gives rise—surely a distinctly Western development—are 
only a beginner's attempt compared to what is an im¬ 
memorial art in the East.” 10 

And yet Jung has referred only to certain parts of Eastern 
thought The whole cannot be studied by means of the parts, 
and the beginner cannot judge the work of the adept, in 
any field, Sufism included. 

The so-called scientific approach to the human phenom¬ 
enon and man's relationship with the rest of being is every 
bit as limited as ordinary philosophy. Like discursive rea¬ 
son, science operates only within the convenient circle of 
what fits in with its preconceptions, as Professor Graves re¬ 
minds us: 

• • scientists are careful to express their suppositions 
in mathematical formulas which, applied artistically to such 
problems as the structure of the atom or the inner tempera¬ 
ture of stars, give 'beautiful’ results. They are applied only 

10 C. G. Jung, Modern Man in Search of a Soul, London, 1959, 
pp. 250-51; ana see annotation “Consciousness.” 



THE SUFIS 


6o 

to safe, prepared cases—though remaining unworkable in 
unstereotyped ones: there must be a sympathetic equiva¬ 
lence between formula and case. ... A beautiful result 
is as good as a demonstrable proof and can be superseded 
only by a still more beautiful result.” 11 

Again the doctrine that the whole cannot be studied by 
means of the parts, plus the fact that a thing cannot study 
all of itself simultaneously. The Sufi master Pir-i-Do-Sara 
says: 

"Can you imagine a mind observing the whole of itself— 
if it were all engaged in observation, what would it be ob¬ 
serving? If it were all engaged in being mind, what would 
do the observing? Observation of self is necessary while 
there is a self as distinct from the nonself part. . . .” 12 

The Sufis affirm that the organism known generally as 
Sufism has been the one stream of direct, evolutionary ex¬ 
perience which has been the determining factor in all the 
great schools of mysticism. In order to verify this as far as 
possible, there is some interest in following the movement 
of Sufic ideas. If they prove to have a penetrative power, an 
ability to influence thought and action in divers communi¬ 
ties, the inner dynamism of the system can very well be in¬ 
ferred. Is there, in other words, reason to suppose that the 
Sufic stream has the power to influence human thinking in, 
say, western Europe? During the fairly well documented 
classical period of Sufism, has it penetrated through the 
screen of the dark ages, providing power and development 
for communities which have a different background? Is Su¬ 
fism organic in this respect? 

This suggestion implies that, from remote times, Sufi 
masters have transmitted their lore into almost every society. 
Sufi tradition claims that this has been the fact. In more 
modem times this claim can only be tested by the visible 
appearance of Sufi practices in communities far removed

THE ELEPHANT IN THE DARK 6l 

from the Sufi centers of Asia. The essence of Sufi activity 
would not be so visible. All that one could hope to find 
would be traces here and there, like the radioactive tracers 
sometimes injected into the human bloodstream, of charac¬ 
teristic Sufi lore and practice which still maintained its 
local color. 

Take an example. If Alfonso the Sage wrote in Arabic, 
this might be evidence of Arabian influence. If, however, 
the symbol of a Sufi initiatory society were found among 
the Irish of the ninth century (it was), this might, with other 
evidence, point to a drift of Sufic lore to the West. 

We have looked at certain outstanding characteristics of 
Sufism, but have not noted in starker relief the need for the 
superficially plausible facts of Sufi expression. Here, then, 
as near as they may be transmitted by ordinary words, are 
the rest of Sufi convictions: 

Sufis believe that, expressed in one way, humanity is 
evolving to a certain destiny. We are all taking part in that 
evolution. Organs come into being as a result of the need 
for specific organs (Rumi). The human being's organism is 
producing a new complex of organs in response to such a 
need. In this age of the transcending of time and space, 
the complex of organs is concerned with the transcending 
of time and space. What ordinary people regard as sporadic 
and occasional bursts of telepathic or prophetic power are 
seen by the Sufi as nothing less than the first stirrings of 
these same organs. The difference between all evolution up 
to date and the present need for evolution is that for the 
past ten thousand years or so we have been given the pos¬ 
sibility of a conscious evolution. So essential is this more 
rarefied evolution that our future depends upon it. It can 
be called “learning how to swim," in the words of our fable. 

How are these organs developed? By the Sufi method. 
How do we know that we are developing them? Only 
through experience. In the Sufi system there are a number 
of “stages.” The attainment of these stages is marked by an 
unmistakable if ineffable experience. This experience, when 



62 


THE SUEIS 

it comes, activates the organ in question, gives us a relief 
from our climb upward, and grants us sufficient strength 
to continue the climb. The attainment of stages is perma¬ 
nent. Until one of these stages has been reached, the 
photographic plate, as it were, may have been exposed and 
developed, but has not been fixed; and actual experiences 
are the fixative substance. 

This is the meaning of mystical experience, which, how¬ 
ever, when indulged in without proper harmony with evo¬ 
lution seems merely to be something sublime—a sensation of 
omnipotence or of grace, but no assurance of where the 
happy or unhappy mortal is going next. 

Sufis believe that Sufic activity produces and concen¬ 
trates what might be termed a centrifugal or magnetic 
force. This force calls to similar force elsewhere. With the 
coming together of such forces, work continues. This is an 
explanation of the mysterious "messages , which Sufi teach¬ 
ers get, telling them to repair to such and such a place, in 
order to respond to the call of the force there which has 
become derelict (in the sense of abandoned) or needs their 
reinforcing. 

This is as far as anything in Sufism can be explained in 
formal terms. As for the rest, the only valid thing is the Sufic 
watchword: "He who tastes not, knows not.” (Rumi) 



The Subtleties of Mulla Nasrudin 


When you arrive at the sea, you 
do not talk of the tributary. 

(Hakim Sanai, The Walled Garden of Truth') 


Mulla (Master) Nasrudin is the classical figure devised by 
the dervishes partly for the purpose of halting for a mo¬ 
ment situations in which certain states of mind are made 
clear. The Nasrudin stories, known throughout the Middle 
East, constitute (in the manuscript The Subtleties of the 
Incomparable Nasrudin) one of the strangest achievements 
in the history of metaphysics. Superficially, most of the Nas¬ 
rudin stories may be used as jokes. They are told and retold 
endlessly in the teahouses and the caravanserais, in the 
homes and on the radio waves, of Asia. But it is inherent 
in the Nasrudin story that it may be understood at any one 
of many depths. There is the joke, the moral—and the little 
extra which brings the consciousness of the potential mystic 
a little further on the way to realization. 

Since Sufism is something which is lived as well as some¬ 
thing which is perceived, a Nasrudin tale cannot in itself 
produce complete enlightenment. On the other hand, it 
bridges the gap between mundane life and a transmutation 


64 THE SUFIS 

of consciousness in a manner which no other literary form, 
yet produced has been able to attain. 

The Subtleties has never been presented in full to a 
Western audience, probably because the stories cannot 
properly be translated by a non-Sufi, or even be studied 
out of context, and retain the essential impact Even in the 
East the collection is used for study purposes only by ini¬ 
tiate Sufis. Individual “jokes” from the collection have found 
their way into almost every literature in the world, and a 
certain amount of scholastic attention has been given them 
on this account—as an example of culture drift, or to sup¬ 
port arguments in favor of the basic identity of humor 
everywhere. But if because of their perennial humorous ap¬ 
peal the stories have proved their survival power, this is 
entirely secondary to the intention of the corpus, which is 
to provide a basis for making available the Sufi attitude to¬ 
ward life, and for making possible the attainment of Sufic 
realization and mystical experience. 

The Legend of Nasrudin, appended to the Subtleties and 
dating from at least the thirteenth century, touches on some 
of the reasons for introducing Nasrudin. Humor cannot be 
prevented from spreading; it has a way of slipping through 
the patterns of thought which are imposed upon mankind 
by habit and design. As a complete system of thought, 
Nasrudin exists at so many depths that he cannot be killed. 
Some measure of the truth of this might be seen in the fact 
that such diverse and alien organizations as the British 
Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge and the 
Soviet Government have both pressed Nasrudin into serv¬ 
ice. The S. P. C. K. published a few of the stories as Tales 
of the Khoja; while (perhaps on the principle of “If you 
cannot beat them, join them”) the Russians made a film of 
Nasrudin under die name of The Adventures of Nasrudin . 
Even the Greeks, who accepted few other things from the 
Turks, consider him a part of their cultural heritage. Secular 
Turkey, through its information department, has published 
a selection of the metaphysical jokes attributed to this sup- 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 65 

posed Moslem preacher who is the archetype of the Sufi 
mystic. And yet the dervish Orders were suppressed by law 
in republican Turkey. 

Nobody really knows who Nasrudin was, where he 
lived, or when. This is truly in character, for the whole in¬ 
tention is to provide a figure who cannot really be charac¬ 
terized, and who is timeless. It is the message, not the man, 
which is important to the Sufis. This has not prevented peo¬ 
ple from providing him with a spurious history, and even a 
tomb. Scholars, against whose pedantry in his stories 
Nasrudin frequently emerges triumphant, have even tried 
to take his Subtleties to pieces in the hope of finding ap¬ 
propriate biographical material. One of their “discoveries* 
would have warmed the heart of Nasrudin himself. Nas¬ 
rudin said that he considered himself upside down in this 
world, argues one scholar; and from this he infers that the 
supposed date of Nasrudin's death, or his “tombstone,* 
should be read not as 386, but 683. Another professor feels 
that the Arabic numerals used would, if truly reversed, 
look more like the figures 274. He gravely records that a 
dervish to whom he appealed for aid in this “. . . merely 
said, Why not drop a spider in some ink and see what marks 
he makes in crawling out of it. This should give the cor¬ 
rect date or show something/ * 

In fact, 386 means 300 +80 + 6. Transposed into 
Arabic letters, this decodes as SH, W, F, which spells the 
word ShaWaF: “to cause someone to see; to show a thing.* 
The dervish's spider would “show* something, as he him¬ 
self said. 

If we look at some of the classical Nasrudin stories in as 
detached a way as possible, we soon find that the wholly 
scholastic approach is the last one that the Sufi will allow: 

Nasrudin, ferrying a pedant across a piece of rough 
water, said something ungrammatical to him. “Have you 
never studied grammar?” asked the scholar. 

“No.” 

“Then half of your life has been wasted.” 



66 


THE SUFIS 


A few minutes later Nasrudin turned to the passenger, 
"Have you ever learned how to swim?” 

"No, Why?” 

“Then all your life is wasted—we are sinking!” 

This is the emphasis upon Sufism as a practical activity, 
denying that the formal intellect can arrive at truth, and 
that pattern-thinking derived from the familiar world can 
be applied to true reality, which moves in another dimen¬ 
sion. 

This is brought out even more forcefully in a wry tale 
set in a teahouse; a Sufi term for a meeting place of 
dervishes. A monk enters and states: 

"My master taught me to spread the word that mankind 
will never be fulfilled until the man who has not been 
wronged is as indignant about a wrong as the man who 
actually has been wronged.” 

The assembly is momentarily impressed. Then Nasrudin 
speaks: 

"My master taught me that nobody at all should become 
indignant about anything until he is sure that what he 
thinks is a wrong is in fact a wrong—and not a blessing 
in disguise!” 

Nasrudin, in his capacity as a Sufi teacher, makes fre¬ 
quent use of the dervish technique of himself playing the 
part of the unenlightened man in the story, in order to high¬ 
light a truth. A famous tale denying the superficial belief 
in cause and effect makes him the victim: 

Mulla Nasrudin was walking along an alleyway one day 
when a man fell from a roof and landed on top of him. The 
other man was unhurt—but the Mulla was taken to the 
hospital. 

"What teaching do you infer from this event, Master?” 
one of his disciples asked him. 

"Avoid belief in inevitability, even if cause and effect 
seem inevitable! Shun theoretical questions like: ‘If a man 
falls off a roof, will his neck be broken?' He fell—but my 
neck is broken!” 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 67 

Because the average person thinks in patterns and can¬ 
not accommodate himself to a really different point of view, 
he loses a great deal of the meaning of life. He may live, 
even progress, but he cannot understand all that is going 
on. The story of the smuggler makes this very clear: 

Nasrudin used to take his donkey across a frontier every 
day, with the panniers loaded with straw. Since he admit¬ 
ted to being a smuggler when he trudged home every night, 
the frontier guards searched him again and again. They 
searched his person, sifted the straw, steeped it in water, 
even burned it from time to time. Meanwhile he was be¬ 
coming visibly more and more prosperous. 

Then he retired and went to live in another country. 
Here one of the customs officers met him, years later. 

“You can tell me now, Nasrudin," he said. “Whatever 
was it that you were smuggling, when we could never 
catch you out?" 

“Donkeys," said Nasrudin. 

This story also emphasizes one of the major contentions 
of Sufism—that preternatural experience and the mystical 
goal is something nearer to mankind than is realized. The 
assumption that something esoteric or transcendental must 
be far off or complicated has been assumed by the ignorance 
of individuals. And that kind of individual is the least 
qualified to judge the matter. It is “far off" only in a direc¬ 
tion which he does not realize. 

Nasrudin, like the Sufi himself, does not violate (he 
canons of his time. But he adds a new dimension to his con¬ 
sciousness, refusing to accept for specific, limited purposes 
that truth, say, is something that can be measured as can 
anything else. What people call truth is relative to their 
situation. And he cannot find it until he realizes this. One 
of the Nasrudin tales, a most ingenious one, shows (hat until 
one can see through relative truth, no progress can be made: 

One day Nasrudin was sitting at court. The King was 
complaining that his subjects were untruthful. “Majesty,” 
said Nasrudin, “there is truth and truth. People must 



68 


THE SUEIS 


practice real truth before they can use relative truth. They 
always try the other way around. The result is that they take 
liberties with their man-made truth, because they know in¬ 
stinctively that it is only an invention.” 

The King thought that this was too complicated. “A thing 
must be true or false. I will make people tell the truth, and 
by this practice they will establish the habit of being truth¬ 
ful.” 

When the city gates were opened the next morning, a 
gallows had been erected in front of them, presided over 
by the captain of the royal guard. A herald announced: 
“Whoever would enter the city must first answer the truth 
to a question which will be put to him by the captain of 
the guard.” 

Nasrudin, who had been waiting outside, stepped for¬ 
ward first. 

The captain spoke: ‘Where are you going? Tell the 
truth—the alternative is death by hanging.” 

T am going,” said Nasrudin, “to be hanged on those gal¬ 
lows.” 

“I don’t believe you!” 

“Very well, then. If I have told a lie, hang me!” 

“But that would make it the truth!” 

“Exactly,” said Nasrudin, “your truth.” 

The would-be Sufi must also understand that standards 
of good and bad depend upon individual or group criteria, 
not upon objective fact. Until he experiences this internally 
as well as accepting it intellectually, he will not be able to 
qualify for inner understanding. This shifting scale is ex¬ 
emplified by a story of the chase: 

A king who enjoyed Nasrudin’s company, and also liked 
to hunt, commanded him to accompany him on a bear hunt 
Nasrudin was terrified. 

When Nasrudin returned to his village, someone asked 
him: “How did the hunt go?” 

“Marvelously.” 

“How many bears did you see?” 


THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 69 

"None.” 

"How could it have gone marvelously, then?” 

"When you are hunting bears, and when you are me, 
seeing no bears at all is a marvelous experience.” 

Internal experience cannot be transmitted through repe- 
titiousness, but has to be constantly refreshed from the 
source. Many schools continue to operate long after their 
actual dynamic is exhausted, becoming mere centers repeat¬ 
ing a progressively weakened doctrine. The name of the 
teaching may remain the same. The teaching may have no 
value, may even oppose the original meaning, is almost al¬ 
ways a travesty of it. Nasrudin emphasizes this as one of 
the points in his "Duck Soup” story: 

A kinsman came to see the Mulla from somewhere deep 
in the country, bringing a duck as a gift Delighted, 
Nasrudin had the bird cooked and shared it with his guest 
Presently, however, one countryman after another started 
to call, each one the friend of the friend of the "man who 
brought you the duck.” No further presents were forth¬ 
coming. 

At length the Mulla was exasperated. One day yet an¬ 
other stranger appeared. "I am the friend of the friend of 
the friend of the relative who brought you the duck.” 

He sat down, like all the rest, expecting a meal. Nasrudin 
handed him a bowl of hot water. 

"What is this?” 

"That is the soup of the soup of the soup of the duck 
which was brought by my relative.” 

The sharpened perception which the Sufi attains some¬ 
times enables him to experience things which are imper¬ 
ceptible to others. Ignorant of this, members of other schools 
generally give away their lack of perception by saying or 
doing something which is so obviously the result of spiritual 
immaturity that the Sufi can read him like a book. In these 
circumstances Sufis seldom trouble to say anything. The 
perception, however, is illustrated by another Nasrudin 
tale: 



THE SUFIS 


70 

Nasrudin called at a large house to collect for charity. 
The servant said, “My master is out.” 

“Very well,” said the Mulla; “even though he has not 
been able to contribute, please give your master a piece of 
advice from me. Say: TNfext time you go out, don't leave 
your face at the window—someone might steal it/ ” 

People do not know where to look when they are seeking 
enlightenment As a result, it is hardly surprising that they 
may attach themselves to any cult, immerse themselves in 
all manner of theories, believing that they have the capacity 
to distinguish the true from the false. 

Nasrudin taught this in several ways. On one occasion a 
neighbor found him down on his knees looking for some¬ 
thing. 

“What have you lost, Mulla?” 

“My key,” said Nasrudin. 

After a few minutes of searching, the other man said, 
“Where did you drop it?” 

“At home.” 

“Then why, for heaven's sake, are you looking here?” 

“There is more light here.” 

This is one of the most famous of all Nasrudin tales, used 
by many Sufis, commenting upon people who seek exotic 
sources for enlightenment. Acting it on the stage was a part 
of the repertoire of Karl Vallentin, the late “metaphysical 
clown” of Munich, 

The mechanism of rationalization is one which effectively 
bars the deepening of perception. The Sufic impact may 
often be wasted because the individual will not properly 
absorb it. 

A neighbor came to borrow Nasrudin’s clothesline. 

T am sorry, but I am drying flour on it.” 

“But how can you dry flour on a line?” 

“It is less difficult than you think, when you don’t want 
to lend it.” 

Nasrudin here presents himself as the evasive part of 



THE SUBTLETIES OE MULLA NASRUDIN J I 

the mind, which will not accept that there are other ways 
of approaching truth than the conventional patterns. 

In the development of the human mind, there is a con¬ 
stant change and limit to the usefulness of any particular 
technique. This characteristic of Sufi practice is ignored in 
repetitious systems, which condition the mind and create 
an atmosphere of attainment or nearness to attainment, 
without actually producing it. Nasrudin figures as the char¬ 
acter in a story which seeks to make this clear: 

The Mulla nearly fell into a pool of water* A passer-by 
saved him in the nick of time. Every time they met in fu¬ 
ture, the man reminded Nasrudin about how he had pre¬ 
vented him from getting wet. 

Ultimately, unable to stand it any longer, the Mulla took 
his friend to the pool, jumped in as far as the neck, and 
shouted: “Now I am as wet as I would have been if I had 
never met you! Will you leave me alone?” 

The ordinary joke or fable, containing only one point or 
emphasis, cannot be compared to the Nasrudin system— 
ideally a participation-recital which exercises an inward as 
well as an outward or superficial effect The parable, fable 
and ordinary joke are considered mystically sterile because 
they lack penetration or true regenerative force. 

While the complex ingenuity and intention of the 
Nasrudin story is far ahead of, say, the Baldaldev figure of 
the Russians, the Arab Joha, or Bertoldo of the Italians—all 
well-known comical figures—something of the difference of 
depth in stories can be assessed by means of the Mullah 
jokes and their equivalent in their sporadic occurrence else¬ 
where. 

A Zen story provides an interesting example. In this a 
monk asks a master to give him a version of the reality be¬ 
yond reality. The master snatches up a rotten apple; and 
the monk perceives the truth by means of this sign. We are 
left in the dark as to what lies behind, or leads up to, the 
illumination. 

The Nasrudin story about an apple fills in a great deal of 



THE SUFIS 


7 2 

missing detail: Nasrudin is sitting among a circle of 
disciples, when one of them asks him the relationship be¬ 
tween things of this world and things of a different dimen¬ 
sion. Nasrudin says, “You must understand allegory." The 
disciple says, “Show me something practical—for instance 
an apple from Paradise." 

Nasrudin picks up an apple and hands it to the man. 
“But this apple is bad on one side—surely a heavenly apple 
would be perfect." 

“A celestial apple would be perfect," says Nasrudin; “but 
as far as you are able to judge it, situated as we are in this 
abode of corruption, and with your present faculties, this 
is as near to a heavenly apple as you will ever get." 

The disciple understood that the terms which we use for 
metaphysical things are based upon physical terms. In order 
to penetrate into another dimension of cognition, we have 
to adjust to the way of understanding of that dimension. 

The Nasrudin story, which may well be the original of 
the apple allegory, is designed to add to the mind of the 
hearer something of the flavor which is needed to build up 
the consciousness for experiences which cannot be reached 
until a bridge has been created. 

This gradual building up of inner consciousness is char¬ 
acteristic of the Nasrudin Sufic method. The flash of in¬ 
tuitive illumination which comes as a result of the stories is 
partly a minor enlightenment in itself, not an intellectual 
experience. It is also a steppingstone toward the reestablish¬ 
ing of mystical perception in a captive mind, relentlessly 
conditioned by the training systems of material life. 

A Nasrudin joke, detached (perhaps by translation) from 
its technical terminology, can still pass current on its 
humorous value. In such cases much of its impact may be 
lost. An example is the salt and wool joke: 

Nasrudin is taking a load of salt to market. His donkey 
wades through a stream, and the salt is dissolved. When it 
reaches the opposite bank, the ass is frisky because his load 
is lightened. But Nasrudin is angry. On the next market day 



THE SUBTLETIES OE MULLA NASRUDIN 73 

he packs the panniers with wool. The animal is almost 
drowned with the increase of weight when it takes up water 
at the ford. 

“There!” says Nasrudin triumphantly, “that'll teach you 
to think that you gain something every time you go through 
water!” 

In the original story, two technical terms are used, salt 
and wool. “Salt” (mil'll) is the homonym for “being good, 
wisdom.” The donkey is the symbol for man. By shedding 
his burden of general goodness, the individual feels better, 
loses the weight. The result is that he loses his food, because 
Nasrudin could not sell the salt to buy fodder. The word 
“wool” is of course another word for “Sufi.” On the second 
trip the donkey had an increase of his burden through the 
wool, because of the intention of his teacher, Nasrudin. 
The weight is increased for the duration of the journey to 
market. But the end result is better, because Nasrudin sells 
the damp wool, now heavier than before, for a higher price 
than dry wool. 

Another joke, found also in Cervantes (Don Quixote , 
Ch. 5) remains a joke although the technical term “fear” 
is merely translated and not explained: 

“I shall have you hanged,” said a cruel and ignorant king 
to Nasrudin, “if you do not prove that you have deep per¬ 
ceptions such as have been attributed to you.” Nasrudin at 
once said that he could see a golden bird in the sky and 
demons within the earth. “But how can you do this?” the 
King asked. “Fear,” said the Mulla, “is all you need.” 

“Fear,” in the Sufi vocabulary, is the activation of con¬ 
science whose exercises can produce extrasensory percep¬ 
tion. This is an area in which the formal intellect is not 
used, and other faculties of the mind are called into play. 

Yet Nasrudin, in a manner wholly unique, manages to 
use the very fabric of intellectuality for his own purposes. 
An echo of this deliberate intent is found in the Legend of 
Nasrudin, where it is recounted that Hussein, the founder 
of the system, snatched his messenger-designate Nasrudin 



THE SUPIS

from the very clutches of the “Old Villain'—the crude sys¬ 
tem of thought in which almost all of us live. 

“Hussein" is associated in Arabic with the concept of 
virtue. “Hassein" means “strong, difficult of access." 

When Hussein had searched the whole world for the 
teacher who was to carry his message through the genera¬ 
tions, he was almost at the point of despair when he heard 
a commotion. The Old Villain was upbraiding one of his 
students for telling jokes. “Nasrudin!" thundered the Vil¬ 
lain, “for your irreverent attitude I condemn you to uni¬ 
versal ridicule. Henceforth, when one of your absurd 
stories is told, six more will have to be heard in succession, 
until you are clearly seen to be a figure of fun." 

It is believed that the mystical effect of seven Nasrudin 
tales, studied in succession, is enough to prepare an individ¬ 
ual for enlightenment. 

Hussein, eavesdropping, realized that from every situa¬ 
tion comes forth its own remedy; and that this was the man¬ 
ner in which the evils of the Old Villain could be brought 
into their true perspective. He would preserve truth 
through Nasrudin. 

He called Nasrudin to him in a dream and imparted to 
him a portion of his baraka, the Sufi power which inter¬ 
penetrates the nominal significance of meaning. Hence¬ 
forth all the stories about Nasrudin became works of “in¬ 
dependent" art. They could be understood as jokes, they 
had a metaphysical meaning; they were infinitely complex 
and partook of the nature of completion and perfection 
which had been stolen from human consciousness by the 
vitiating activities of the Old Villain. 

Baraka, looked at from the ordinary viewpoint, has many 
“magical" qualities—although it is essentially a unity and 
the fuel as well as the substance of objective reality. One 
of these qualities is that anyone who is endowed with it, 
or any object with which it is associated, retains a quota of 
it, no matter how much it may be altered by the impact of 
unregenerate people. Hence the mere repetition of a Nas- 



THE SUBTLETIES OE MULLA NASRUDIN 75 

rudin jest takes with it some baraka; pondering over it 
brings more. "So that by this method the teachings of Nas- 
rudin in the line of Hussein were impressed forever within 
a vehicle which could not be utterly distorted beyond repair. 
Just as all water is essentially water, so within the Nasrudin 
experiences there is an irreducible minimum which answers 
a call, and which grows when it is invoked." This minimum 
is truth, and through truth, real consciousness. 

Nasrudin is the mirror in which one sees oneself. Unlike 
an ordinary mirror, the more it is gazed into, the more of 
the original Nasrudin is projected into it This mirror is 
likened to the celebrated Cup of Jamshid, the Persian hero; 
which mirrors the whole world, and into which the Sufis 
"gaze." 

Since Sufism is not built upon artificial conduct or be¬ 
havior in the sense of external detail, but upon comprehen¬ 
sive detail, the Nasrudin stories must be experienced as well 
as thought about Further, the experiencing of each story 
will contribute toward the ‘homecoming" of the mystic. 
One of the first developments of homecoming is when the 
Sufi shows signs of superior perception. He will be able 
to understand a situation, for example, by inspiration, not 
formal cerebration. His actions, as a result may sometimes 
baffle observers working on the ordinary plane of con¬ 
sciousness; but his results will nevertheless be correct 

One Nasrudin story, showing how the right result comes 
for the Sufi through a special mechanism ("the wrong 
method," to the uninitiated) explains much of the seeming 
eccentricities of Sufis: 

Two men came before Nasrudin when he was acting in 
his capacity of magistrate. One said, "This man has bitten 
my ear—I demand compensation." The other said, "He bit it 
himself." Nasrudin adjourned the case and withdrew to 
his chambers. There he spent half an hour trying to bite 
his own ear. All that he succeeded in doing was falling over 
in the attempt, and bruising his forehead. Then he returned 
to the courtroom. 



76 


THE SUEIS 


"Examine the man whose ear was bitten," he ordered. 
"If his forehead is bruised, he did it himself, and the ease 
is dismissed. If not, the other one did it, and the bitten man 
is compensated with three silver pieces." The right verdict 
had been arrived at by seemingly illogical methods. 

Here Nasrudin arrived at the correct answer, irrespec¬ 
tive of the apparent logic of the situation. In another story, 
himself adopting the role of fool ("the Path of Blame," to 
the Sufi), Nasrudin illustrates, in extreme form, ordinary 
human thinking: 

Someone asked Nasrudin to guess what he had in his 
hand. 

"Give me a clue," said the Mulla. 

Til give you several," said the wag. "It is shaped like an 
egg, egg-sized, looks, tastes and smells like an egg. Inside it 
is yellow and white. It is liquid within before you cook it, 
coalesces with heat. It was, moreover, laid by a hen. . . ." 

"I know!" interrupted the Mulla. "It is some sort of cake." 

I tried a similar experiment in London. At three tobac¬ 
conists I successively asked for "cylinders of paper filled 
with particles of tobacco, about three inches long, packed 
in cartons, probably with printing on them.” 

None of the people who sold cigarettes all day long could 
identify what I wanted. Two directed me elsewhere—one 
to their wholesalers, another to a shop which specialized 
in exotic imports for smokers. 

The word "cigarette" may be a necessary trigger to de¬ 
scribe paper cylinders filled with tobacco. But the trigger 
habit, depending upon associations, cannot be used in the 
same way in perceptive activities. The mistake is in carry¬ 
ing over one form of thinking—however admirable in its 
proper place—into another context, and trying to use it 
there. 

Rumi tells a story which resembles Nasrudin’s tale of the 
egg, but emphasizes another significant factor. A king’s son 
had been placed in the hands of mystical teachers who re¬ 
ported that they now could not teach him any more. In 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 77 

order to test him, the King asked him what he had in his 
hand. “It is round, metallic and yellow—it must be a sieve,” 
the boy replied. Sufism insists upon a balanced development 
of inner perceptions and ordinary human conduct and 
usage. 

The assumption that just because one is alive, one is per¬ 
ceptive, is denied by Sufism, as we have already seen. A man 
may be clinically alive, but perceptively dead. Logic and 
philosophy will not help him in attaining perception. One 
aspect of the following story illustrates this: 

The Mulla was thinking aloud. 

“How do I know whether I am dead or alive?” 

“Don’t be such a fool,” his wife said; “if you were dead 
your limbs would be cold.” 

Shortly afterward Nasrudin was in the forest cutting 
wood. It was midwinter. Suddenly he realized that his hands 
and feet were cold. 

“I am undoubtedly dead,” he thought; “so I must stop 
working, because corpses do not work.” 

And, because corpses do not walk about, he lay down 
on the grass. 

Soon a pack of wolves appeared and started to attack 
Nasrudin’s donkey, which was tethered to a tree. 

“Yes, carry on, take advantage of a dead man,” said 
Nasrudin from his prone position; “but if I had been alive 
I would not have allowed you to take liberties with my 
donkey.” 

The preparation of the Sufi mind cannot be adequate 
until the man knows that he has to make something for him¬ 
self—and stops thinking that others can make it for him. 
Nasrudin brings the ordinary man under his magnifying 
lens: 

One day Nasrudin went into the shop of a man who sold 
all kinds of miscellaneous things. 

“Have you leather?” 

“Yes.” 

“And nails?” 



THE SUFIS 


78 

“Yes ” 

"And dye?” 

"Yes” 

"Then why don't you mate yourself a pair of boots?” 

The story emphasizes the role of the mystical master, 
essential in Sufism, who provides the starting point for the 
would-be seeker to do something about himself—that some¬ 
thing being the "self-wort” under guidance which is the 
outstanding characteristic of the Sufi system. 

The Sufi quest cannot be carried out in unacceptable 
company. Nasrudin emphasizes this point in his tale of the 
ill-timed invitation: 

The hour was late, and the Mulla had been talking to 
his friends in a teahouse. As they left, they realized that 
they were hungry. "Come and eat at my home, all of you,” 
said Nasrudin, without thinking of the consequences. 

When the party had nearly arrived at his house, he 
thought he should go on ahead and tell his wife. "You stay 
here while I warn her,” he told them. 

When he told her, she said, 'There is nothing in the 
house! How dare you invite all those people!” 

Nasrudin went upstairs and hid himself. 

Presently hunger drove his guests to approach the house 
and knock on the door. 

Nasrudin's wife answered. "The Mulla is not at home!” 

"But we saw him going in through the front door,” they 
shouted. 

She could not think, for the moment, of anything to 
say. 

Overcome by anxiety, Nasrudin, who had been watching 
the interchange from an upstairs window, leaned out and 
said, "I could have gone out again by the back door, couldn't 
I?” 

Several of the Nasrudin tales emphasize the falsity of the 
general human belief that man has a stable consciousness. 
At the mercy of inner and outer impacts, the behavior of 
almost anyone will vary in accordance with his mood and 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 79 

his state of health* While this fact is of course recognized in 
social life, it is not fully admitted in formal philosophy or 
metaphysics. At best, the individual is expected to create in 
himself a framework of devoutness or concentration 
through which it is hoped that he will attain illumination 
or fulfillment. In Sufism, it is the entire consciousness which 
has ultimately to be transmuted, starting from the recogni¬ 
tion that the unregenerate man is very little more than raw 
material. He has no fixed nature, no unity of consciousness. 
Inside him there is an "essence." This is not yoked to his 
whole being, or even his personality. Ultimately, nobody 
automatically knows who he really is. This in spite of the 
fiction to the contrary. Thus Nasrudin: 

The Mulla walked into a shop one day. 

The owner came forward to serve him. 

"First things first," said Nasrudin; "did you see me walk 
into your shop?" 

"Of course." 

"Have you ever seen me before?" 

"Never in my life." 

"Then how do you know it is me?” 

Excellent as this may be as a mere joke, those who re¬ 
gard it as the idea of a stupid man, and containing no 
deeper significance, will not be people who are in a posi¬ 
tion to benefit from its regenerative power. You extract 
from a Nasrudin story only a very little more than you put 
into it; if it appears to be no more than a joke to a person, 
that person is in the need of further self-work. He is cari¬ 
catured in the Nasrudin interchange about the moon: 

"What do they do with the moon when it is old?" a stupid 
man asked the Mulla. 

The answer fitted the question: "They cut each old moon 
up into forty stars." 

Many of the Nasrudin tales highlight the fact that peo¬ 
ple seeking mystical attainment expect it on their own 
terms, and hence generally exclude themselves from it be¬ 
fore they start. Nobody can hope to arrive at illumination 



THE SUFIS

if he thinks that he knows what it is, and believes that he 
can achieve it through a well-defined path which he can 
conceive at the moment of starting. Hence the story of the 
woman and the sugar: 

When Nasrudin was a magistrate, a woman came to him 
with her son. “This youth,” she said, “eats too much sugar. 
I cannot afford to keep him in it Therefore I ask you for¬ 
mally to forbid him to eat it, as he will not obey me.” 

Nasrudin told her to come back in seven days. 

When she returned, he postponed his decision for yet 
another week. 

“Now,” he said to the youth, T forbid you to eat more 
than such and such a quantity of sugar every day.” 

The woman subsequently asked him why so much time 
had been necessary before a simple order could be given. 

“Because, madam, I had to see whether I myself could 
cut down on the use of sugar, before ordering anyone else 
to do it” 

The woman’s request had been made, in accordance with 
most automatic human thinking, simply on the basis of cer¬ 
tain assumptions. The first was that justice can be done 
merely by giving injunctions; secondly, that a person could 
in fact eat as little sugar as she wanted her son to eat; 
thirdly, that a thing can be communicated to another per¬ 
son by someone who is not himself involved in it 

This tale is not simply a way of paraphrasing the state¬ 
ment: “Do as I say, not as I do.” Far from being an ethical 
teaching, it is one of grim necessity. 

Sufi teaching can only be done by a Sufi, not by a theore¬ 
tician or intellectual exponent 

Sufism, since it is the attunement with true reality, can¬ 
not be made closely to resemble what we take to be reality, 
but which is really more primitive short-term rule of thumb. 
For example, we tend to look at events one-sidedly. We also 
assume, without any justification, that an event happens as 
it were in a vacuum. In actual fact, all events are associated 
with all other events. It is only when we are ready to ex- 



THE SUBTLETIES OE MULLA NASRUDIN 8 1 

perience our interrelation with the organism o£ life that we 
can appreciate mystical experience. If you look at any ac¬ 
tion which you do, or which anyone else does, you will 
find that it was prompted by one of many possible stimuli; 
and also that it is never an isolated action—it has conse¬ 
quences, many of them ones which you would never ex¬ 
pect, certainly which you could not have planned. 

Another Nasrudin “joke” underlines this essential circu¬ 
larity of reality, and the generally invisible interactions 
which occur : 

One day Nasrudin was walking along a deserted road. 
Night was falling as he spied a troop of horsemen coming 
toward him. His imagination began to work, and he feared 
that they might rob him, or impress him into the army. So 
strong did this fear become that he leaped over a wall and 
found himself in a graveyard. The other travelers, innocent 
of any such motive as had been assumed by Nasrudin, be¬ 
came curious and pursued him. 

When they came upon him lying motionless, one said, 
“Can we help you—why are you here in this position?” 

Nasrudin, realizing his mistake, said, “It is more compli¬ 
cated than you assume. You see, I am here because of you; 
and you, you are here because of me” 

It is only the mystic who “returns” to the formal world 
after literal experience of the interdependence of seemingly 
different or unconnected things, who can truly perceive life 
in this way. To the Sufi, any metaphysical method which 
does not embrace this factor is a concocted (external) one, 
and cannot be the product of what he calls mystical experi¬ 
ence. Its very existence is a barrier to the attainment of its 
purported aim. 

This is not to say that the Sufi, as a result of his experi¬ 
ences, becomes divorced from the reality of superficial life. 
He has an extra dimension of being, which operates par¬ 
allel to the lesser cognition of the ordinary man. The Mulla 
sums this up neatly in another saying: 

“I can see in the dark.” 



82 


THE SUFIS 


"That may be so, Mulla. But if it is true, why do you 
sometimes carry a candle at night?” 

"To prevent other people from bumping into me.” 

The light carried by the Sufi may be his conforming with 
the ways of the people among whom he is cast, after his 
"return” from being transmuted into a wider perception. 

The Sufi is, by virtue of his transmutation, a conscious 
part of the living reality of all being. This means that he 
cannot look upon what happens—either to himself or to 
others—in the limited way in which the philosopher or 
theologian does. Someone once asked Nasrudin what Fate 
was. He said, “What you call Tate' is really assumption. You 
assume that something good or bad is going to happen. The 
actual result you call Tate/” The question, "Are you a 
fatalist?” cannot be asked of a Sufi, because he does not 
accept the unsubstantiated concept of Fate which is implied 
in the question. 

Similarly, since he can perceive the ramifications in depth 
of an event, the Sufi's attitude toward individual happenings 
is comprehensive, not isolated. He cannot generalize from 
artificially separated data. "Nobody can ride that horse/ 
the King said to me,” said the Mulla; "but I climbed into 
the saddle.” ‘What happened?” "I couldn't move it either,” 
This is intended to show that when an apparently con¬ 
sistent fact is extended along its dimensions, it changes. 

The so-called problem of communication, which engages 
so much attention, hinges on assumptions that are unac¬ 
ceptable to the Sufi. The ordinary man says, "How can I 
communicate with another man beyond very ordinary 
things?” The Sufi attitude is that “communication of things 
which have to be communicated cannot be prevented. It 
is not that a means has to be found.” 

Nasrudin and a Yogi, in one of the tales, both play the 
part of ordinary people who have, in fact, nothing to com¬ 
municate to one another: 

One day Nasrudin saw a strange-looking building at 
whose door a contemplative Yogi sat. The Mulla decided 



THE SUBTLETIES OE MULLA NASRUDIN 83 

that he would learn something from this impressive figure, 
and started a conversation by asking him who and what 
he was. 

“I am a Yogi,” said the other, “and I spend my time in 
trying to attain harmony with all living things.” 

“That is interesting,” said Nasrudin, “because a fish once 
saved my life.” 

The Yogi begged him to join him, saying that in a life¬ 
time devoted to trying to harmonize himself with the animal 
creation, he had never been so close to such communion as 
the Mulla had been. 

When they had been contemplating for some days, the 
Yogi begged the Mulla to tell him more of his wonderful 
experience with the fish, “now that we know one another 
better.” 

“Now that I know you better,” said Nasrudin, “I doubt 
whether you would profit by what I have to tell.” 

But the Yogi insisted. “Very well,” said Nasrudin. “The 
fish saved my life all right. I was starving at the time, and 
it sufficed me for three days.” 

The meddling with certain capacities of the mind which 
characterizes so-called experimental mysticism is something 
which no Sufi would dare to do. The product of consistent 
experimentation countless centuries ago, Sufism actually 
deals in phenomena which are still elusive to the empiric: 

Nasrudin was throwing handfuls of bread all round his 
house. “What are you doing?” someone asked. 

“Keeping the tigers away.” 

“But there are no tigers around here.” 

“Exactly. Effective, isn’t it?” 

One of several Nasrudin tales which are found in Cer¬ 
vantes' Don Quixote (Ch. 14) warns of the dangers of 
rigid intellectualism: 

“There is nothing which cannot be answered by means 
of my doctrine,” said a monk who had just entered a tea¬ 
house where Nasrudin was sitting with his friends. 

“And yet just a short time ago,” replied the Mulla, “I was 


84 THE SUFIS 

challenged by a scholar with an unanswerable question.” 

“If only I had been there! Tell it to me,&gt;and I shall an¬ 
swer it.” 

“Very well. He said, Why are you trying to get into my 
house by night?' ” 

The Sufi perception of beauty is associated with a power 
of penetration which extends beyond the ken of the usual 
forms of art One day a disciple had taken Nasrudin to view, 
for the first time, a beautiful lakeland scene. 

‘What a delight!” he exclaimed. “But if only, if only . • .” 

“If only what, Mulla?” 

“If only they had not put water into it!” 

In order to reach the mystic goal, the Sufi must under¬ 
stand that the mind does not work in the manner in which 
we assume that it does. Furthermore, two people may merely 
confuse one another: 

One day the Mulla asked his wife to make a large quan¬ 
tity of halwa, a heavy sweetmeat, and gave her all the in¬ 
gredients. He ate nearly all of it. 

In the middle of the night, Nasrudin woke her up. 

“I have just had an important thought.” 

‘Tell it to me.” 

“Bring me the rest of the halwa, and I will tell you.” 

When she had brought it, she asked him again. 

The Mulla first finished up the halwa . 

“The thought,” said Nasrudin, “was: 'Never go to sleep 
without finishing up all the halwa that has been made 
during that day/ ” 

Nasrudin enables the Sufi Seeker to understand that the 
formal ideas current about time and space are not neces¬ 
sarily those which obtain the wider field of true reality. 
People who believe, for instance, that they are being re¬ 
warded for past actions and may be rewarded in future for 
future doings, cannot be Sufis. The Sufi time conception is 
an interrelation—a continuum. 

The classic story of the Turkish bath caricatures it in a 
manner which enables something of the idea to be grasped: 



THE SUBTLETIES OE MULLA NASRUDIN 85 

Nasrudin visited a Turkish bath. Because he was 
dressed in rags, he was cavalierly treated by the attendants, 
who gave him an old towel and a scrap of soap. When he 
left, he handed the amazed bath men a gold coin. The 
next day he appeared again, magnificently attired, and was 
naturally given the best possible attention and deference. 

When the bath was over, he presented the bath keepers 
with the smallest copper coin available. 

“This,” he said, “was for the attendance last time. The 
gold coin was for your treatment of me this time.” 

The residue of pattern-thinking, plus a distinct imma¬ 
turity of mind, cause people to attempt to enroll themselves 
in mysticism on their own terms. One of the first things 
taught to the disciple is that he may have an inkling of what 
he needs, and he may realize that he can get it from study 
and work under a master. But beyond that he can make no 
conditions. This is the Nasrudin tale which is used to in¬ 
culcate this truth: 

A woman brought her small son to the Mulla’s school. 
'Please frighten him a little,” she said, “because he is rather 
beyond my control.” 

Nasrudin turned up his eyeballs, started to puff and pant, 
danced up and down and beat his fists on the table until 
the horrified woman fainted. Then he rushed out of the 
room. 

When he returned and the woman had recovered con¬ 
sciousness, she said to him, “I asked you to frighten the 
boy, not me!” 

Madam, said the Mulla, “danger has no favorites. I even 
frightened myself, as you saw. When danger threatens, it 
threatens all equally.” 

Similarly, the Sufi teacher cannot supply his disciple with 
only a small quantity of Sufism. Sufism is the whole, and 
carries with it the implications of completeness, not of the 
fragmentation of consciousness which the unenlightened 
may use in his own processes, and may call “concentration.” 

Nasrudin pokes a great deal of fun at the dabblers, who 



THE SUFIS 


86 

hope to learn, to steal, some deep secret of life, without 
actually paying for it: 

A ship seemed about to sink, and the passengers were 
on their knees praying and repenting, promising to make 
all kinds of amends if only they could be saved. Only Nas- 
rudin was unmoved. 

Suddenly, in the midst of the panic he leaped up and 
shouted, "Steady, now, friends! Don’t change your ways- 
don’t be too prodigal. I think I see land.” 

Nasrudin hammers away at the essential idea—that mys¬ 
tical experience and enlightenment cannot come through a 
rearrangement of familiar ideas, but through a recognition 
of the limitations of ordinary thinking, which serves only 
for mundane purposes. In doing this, he excels beyond 
any other available form of teaching. 

One day he entered a teahouse and declaimed, "The 
moon is more useful than the sun.” 

Someone asked him why. 

"Because at night we need the light more.” 

The conquest of the "Commanding Self” which is an 
object of the Sufi struggle is not achieved merely by acquir¬ 
ing control over one’s passions. It is looked upon as a taming 
of the wild consciousness which believes that it can take 
what it needs from everything (including mysticism) and 
bend it to its own use. The tendency to employ materials 
from whatever source for personal benefit is understand¬ 
able in the partially complete world of ordinary life, but 
cannot be carried over into the greater world of real ful¬ 
fillment. 

In the story of the thieving bird, Nasrudin is carrying 
home a piece of liver and the recipe for liver pie. Suddenly 
a bird of prey swoops down and snatches the meat from his 
hand. As it wings away, Nasrudin calls after it, "Foolish 
bird! You may have the liver, but what will you do with¬ 
out the recipe?” 

From the kite’s point of view, of course, the liver is suffi¬ 
cient for its needs. The result may be a satiated kite, but it 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 87 

gets only what it thinks it wants, not what could have been. 

Since the Sufi is not always understood by other people, 
they will seek to make him conform to their idea of what is 
right. In another Nasrudin bird story (which also appears 
in Rumi’s poetic masterpiece, the Mathnawt), the Mulla 
finds a king’s hawk perched on his window sill. He has 
never seen such a strange “pigeon.” After cutting its aristo¬ 
cratic beak straight and clipping its talons, he sets it free, 
saying, “Nov? you look more like a bird. Someone had neg¬ 
lected you.” 

The artificial division of life, thought and action, so nec¬ 
essary in ordinary human undertakings, has no place in 
Sufism. Nasrudin inculcates this idea as a prerequisite to 
understanding life as a whole. “Sugar dissolved in milk 
permeates all the milk.” 

Nasrudin was walking along a dusty road with a friend, 
when they realized that they were very thirsty. They stopped 
at a teahouse and found that they had between them only 
enough money to buy a glass of milk. The friend said: 
“Drink your half first; I have a twist of sugar here which 
I will add to my share.” 

“Add it now, brother, and we shall both partake,” said 
the Mulla. 

“No, there is not enough to sweeten a whole glass.” 

Nasrudin went to the kitchen, and came back with a 
saltcellar. “Good news, friend—I am having my half with 
salt—and there is enough for the whole glass.” 

Although, in the practical but nonetheless artificial 
world which we have created for ourselves, we are 
accustomed to assuming that “first things come first,” and 
that there must be an A to Z of every thing, this assumption 
cannot hold good in the differently orientated metaphysical 
world. The Sufi Seeker will learn, at one and the same time, 
several different things, at their own levels of perception 
and potentiality. This is another difference between Sufism 
and the systems which rest on the assumption that only one 
thing is being learned at any one moment. 



88 


THE SUFIS 


A dervish teacher comments upon this multiform rela¬ 
tionship of Nasrudin with the Seeker. The tale, he says, is 
in a way like a peach. It has beauty, nutrition, and hidden 
depths—the kernel. 

A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior; 
laugh at the joke, or look at the beauty. But this is only as 
if the peach were lent to you. All that is really absorbed is 
the form and color, perhaps the aroma, the shape and 
texture. 

“You can eat the peach, and taste a further delight— 
understand its depth. The peach contributes to your nutri¬ 
tion, becomes a part of yourself. You can throw away the 
stone—or crack it and „ find a delicious kernel within. This 
is the hidden depth. It has its own color, size, form, depth, 
taste, function. You can collect the shells of this nut, and 
with them fuel a fire. Even if the charcoal is of no further 
use, the edible portion has become a part of you.” 

As soon as the Seeker gains some degree of insight into 
the real workings of existence, he ceases to ask the questions 
which once seemed such urgently relevant ones to the whole 
picture. Further, he sees that a situation can be changed 
by events which seemingly have no relevance to it. The tale 
of the blanket spotlights this: 

Nasrudin and his wife woke one night to hear two men 
fighting below their window. She sent the Mulla out to find 
out what the trouble was. He wrapped his blanket over his 
shoulders and went downstairs. As soon as he approached 
the men, one of them snatched his one and only blanket. 
Then they both ran off. 

'What was the fight about, dear?” his wife asked as he 
entered the bedroom. 

“About my blanket, apparently. As soon as they got that, 
they went away.” 

A neighbor went to Nasrudin, asking to borrow his don¬ 
key. “It is out on loan,” said the Mulla. 

At that moment the donkey was heard to bray, somewhere 
inside the stable.

THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUBIN 

"But I can hear it bray, over there." 

"Whom do you believe," said Nasrudin; "me or a donkey?" 

Experience of this dimension of reality enables the Sufi 
to avoid selfishness and the exercise of the mechanism of 
rationalization—the way of thought which imprisons a part 
of the mind. Nasrudin, in playing the part of a typical 
human being for a moment, brings this point home to 
us: 

A yokel came to the Mulla and said, "Your bull gored my 
cow. Am I entitled to any compensation?" 

"No," said the Mulla at once; "the bull is not responsible 
for its actions." 

"Sorry," said the crafty villager, "I put it the wrong way 
around. I meant that it was your cow which was gored by 
my bull. But the situation is the same." 

"Oh, no," said Nasrudin; "I think I had better look up 
my lawbooks to see whether there is a precedent for this." 

Because the whole body of intellectual human thought is 
expressed in terms of external reasoning, Nasrudin as the 
Sufi teacher returns again and again to an exposure of the 
falsity of ordinary assessment. Attempts at putting into 
speech or writing the mystical experience itself have never 
succeeded, because "those who know do not need it; those 
who do not know cannot gain it without a bridge." Two 
stories of some importance are often used in conjunction 
with Sufi teaching to prepare the mind for experiences out¬ 
side the usual habit-patterns. 

In the first tale, Nasrudin is visited by a would-be dis¬ 
ciple. The man, after many vicissitudes, arrives at the hut 
on the mountain side where the Mulla is sitting. Knowing 
that every single action of the illuminated Sufi is meaning¬ 
ful, the newcomer asks Nasrudin why he is blowing on his 
hands. "To warm myself in the cold, of course." 

Shortly afterward, Nasrudin pours out two bowls of 
soup, and blows on his own. “Why are you doing that, 
Master? asks the disciple. "To cool it, of course," says the 
teacher. 



THE SUFIS

At this point the disciple leaves Nasrudin, unable to trust 
any longer a man who uses the same process to arrive at 
different results—heat and cold. 

Examining a thing by means of itself—the mind by means 
of the mind, creation as it appears to a created but unde¬ 
veloped being—cannot be done. Theorizing based on such 
subjective methods may hold good in the short run, or for 
specific purposes. To the Sufi, however, such theories do 
not represent truth. While he obviously cannot provide an 
alternative in mere words, he can—and does—magnify or 
caricature the process in order to expose it. Once this is done, 
the door is open for seeking an alternative system of assess¬ 
ment of the correlation of phenomena. 

“Every day," says Nasrudin to his wife, “I am more and 
more amazed at the efficient way in which this world is 
organized—generally for the benefit of mankind.” 

'What exactly do you mean?” 

'Well, take camels for instance. Why do you suppose they 
have no wings?” 

“I have no idea.” 

'Well, then; just imagine, if camels had wings, they might 
nest on the roofs of houses and destroy our peace by 
romping about above and spitting their cud down at us.” 

The role of the Sufi teacher is stressed in his famous story 
of the sermon. It shows (among other things, as in all 
Nasrudin tales) that no start can be made on completely 
ignorant people. Further, that those who know need not 
be taught. Finally, that if there are some enlightened people 
in a community, there is no need for a new teacher. 

Nasrudin was invited to give a discourse to the inhabit¬ 
ants of a nearby village. He mounted the rostrum and 
began. 

''O people, do you know what I am about to tell you?” 

Some rowdies, seeking to amuse themselves, shouted, 
“No!” 

“In that case,” said the Mulla with dignity, “I shall ab- 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 9 1 

stain from trying to instruct such an ignorant commu¬ 
nity.” 

The following week, having obtained an assurance from 
the hooligans that they would not repeat their remarks, the 
elders of the village again prevailed upon Nasrudin to ad¬ 
dress them. 

“O people!” he began again; "do you know what I am 
about to say to you?” 

Some of the people, uncertain as to how to react, for he 
was gazing at them fiercely, muttered, "Yes.” 

"In that case,” retorted Nasrudin, "there is no need 
for me to say more.” He left the hall. 

On the third occasion, when a deputation had again 
visited him and implored him to make one further effort, he 
presented himself before the assembly. 

"O people! Do you know what I am about to say?” 

Since he seemed to demand a reply, the villagers shouted, 
"Some of us do, and some of us do not.” 

"In that case,” said Nasrudin as he withdrew, "let those 
who know tell those who do not.” 

In Sufism one cannot start the "work” at a predeter¬ 
mined point. The teacher must be allowed to guide each 
would-be illuminate in his own way. Nasrudin was once 
approached by a young man who asked him how long it 
would take before he became a Sufi. 

He took the young man to the village. "Before I answer 
your question, I want you to come with me, as I am going 
to see a music-master about learning to play the lute.” 

At the musician's house Nasrudin inquired about the 
fees. 

"Three pieces of silver for the first month. After that, one 
silver piece a month.” 

Splendid!” shouted the Mulla; "I shall be back in a 
month's time!” 

The sixth sense which the Sufi acquires, which is as¬ 
sumed by theoreticians to be a sense of complete prescience, 
of almost divine all-knowledge, is nothing of the land. Like 


THE SUFIS 


9 2 

all the other senses it has its limitations. Its function is not 
to make the Perfected Man all-wise, but to enable him to 
fulfill a mission of greater perception and fuller life. He 
no longer suffers from the sense of uncertainty and incom¬ 
pleteness which is familiar to other people. The story of the 
boys and the tree is taken to convey this meaning: 

Some boys wanted to run away with Nasrudin’s slippers. 

As he came along the road they crowded around him and 
said, “Mulla, nobody can climb this tree!” 

“Of course they can,” said Nasrudin. “I shall show you 
how, then you will be able to do it.” 

He was about to leave his slippers on the ground, but 
something warned him, and he tucked them into his belt 
before starting his climb. 

The boys were discomfited. 'What are you taking your 
slippers for?” one shouted up to him. 

“Since this tree has not been climbed, how do I know 
that there is not a road up there?” the Mulla answered. 

When the Sufi is using his intuition, he cannot explain 
his actions plausibly. 

The sixth sense also gives the possessor of baraka the 
means apparently to create certain happenings. This capac¬ 
ity comes to the Sufi by a means other than using formal 
reasoning: 

“Allah will provide recompense,” said Nasrudin to a man 
who had been robbed. 

“I don’t see how it could work,” said the man. 

Nasrudin immediately took him into a nearby mosque, 
and told him to stand in a comer. Then the Mulla started 
to weep and wail, calling upon Allah to restore to the 
man his twenty silver coins. He made such a disturbance 
that the congregation made a collection and handed that 
sum to the man. 

“You may not understand the means which operate in 
this world,” said Nasrudin; “but perhaps you will under¬ 
stand what has happened in Allah’s house.” 

Participating in the working of reality is very different 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 93 

from intellectual extensions of observed fact. In order to 
demonstrate this, Nasrudin once took the slowest of lum¬ 
bering oxen to a horse race which accepted all entrants. 

Everyone laughed, for it is well known that an ox cannot 
run at any speed. 

“Nonsense,” said the Mulla; “it certainly will run very 
fast indeed, given a chance. Why, when it was a calf, you 
should have seen how it ran. Now, though it has had no 
practice, no occasion to run, it is fully grown. Why should 
it not run even faster?” 

The story also combats the belief that just because a 
thing—or person—is old, it is necessarily better than some¬ 
thing which is young. Sufism as a conscious and living 
activity is not tied to the past or hidebound tradition. Every 
Sufi who is living today represents every Sufi who has lived 
in the past, or who will ever live. The same amount of 
baraka is there, and immemorial tradition does not increase 
its romance, which remains constant. 

A further depth of this tale points out that the disciple 
(the calf) may develop into someone with an apparently 
different function (the ox) from what one might have as¬ 
sumed. The clock cannot be turned back. Those who rely 
upon speculative theory cannot rely upon Sufism. 

The absence of an intuitive faculty in mankind in gen¬ 
eral produces an almost hopeless situation; and many Nas¬ 
rudin tales emphasize this fact. 

Nasrudin plays the part of the insensitive, ordinary der¬ 
vish in the story of the bag of rice. One day he disagreed 
with the prior of a monastery at which he was staying. 
Shortly afterward, a bag of rice was missing. The chief 
ordered everyone to line up in the courtyard. Then he told 
them that the man who had stolen the rice had some grains 
of it in his beard. 

“This is an old trick, to make the guilty party touch his 
beard involuntarily,” thought the real thief, and stood firm. 

Nasrudin, on the other hand, thought, “The prior is out 
to revenge himself upon me. He must have planted rice in 



94 


THE SUFIS 


my beard!” He tried to brush it off as inconspicuously as 
he could. 

As his fingers combed his beard, he realized that every¬ 
one was looking at him. 

“I knew, somehow, that he would trap me sooner or later, 
said Nasrudin. 

What some people take to be “hunches” are often really 
the products of neurosis and imagination. 

The spirit of scepticism about metaphysical matters is by 
no means confined to the West. In the East it is not un¬ 
common for people to say that they feel that discipleship in 
a mystical school will deprive them of their autonomy, or 
otherwise rob them of something. Such people are gener¬ 
ally ignored by Sufis, because they have not yet reached the 
stage where they realize that they are already prisoners of a 
far worse tyranny (that of the Old Villain) than anything 
which could be devised for them in a mystical school. There 
is one succinct Nasrudin joke, however, which points this 
out: 

T hear a burglar downstairs,” the Mulla’s wife whispered 
to him one night. 

“Not a sound,” replied Nasrudin. “We have nothing for 
him to steal. With any luck, he might leave something be¬ 
hind.” 

Nasrudin, burglar of many empty houses, always leaves 
something behind—if the inhabitants recognize it. 

In Sufism, practical methods of instruction are essential. 
This is partly because Sufism is an active undertaking; partly 
because, although people pay lip service to truths when they 
are told them, the reality of the truth does not usually pene¬ 
trate beyond their discursive faculty. 

Nasrudin was mending the roof one day when a man 
called him down into the street. When he went down he 
asked the man what he wanted. 

“Money.” 

‘Why did you not say so when you called to me?” 

“I was ashamed to beg.” 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 95 

“Come up to the roof." 

When they reached the roof, Nasrudin started to lay the 
tiles again. The man coughed, and Nasrudin, without look- 
ing up, said, T have no money for you.” 

“What! You could have told me that without bringing me 
up here.” 

“Then how would you have been able to recompense me 
for bringing me down?” 

A great many things are instantly obvious to the Sufi, 
which cannot be arrived at by the average man. An alle¬ 
gory is used to explain some of the amazing acts of Sufi 
initiates, based upon supersensory powers. To the Sufi, 
these are no more miraculous than any of the ordinary senses 
are to the layman. Just how they work cannot be described; 
but a rough analogy can be drawn. 

“Mankind is asleep,” said Nasrudin, when he had been ac¬ 
cused of falling asleep at court one day. “The sleep of the 
sage is powerful, and the 'wakefulness' of the average man 
is almost useless to anyone.” 

The King was annoyed. 

The next day, after a heavy meal, Nasrudin fell asleep, 
and the King had him carried into an adjoining room. 
When the court was about to rise, Nasrudin, still slumber¬ 
ing, was brought back to the audience chamber. 

'You have been asleep again,” said the King. 

“I have been as awake as I needed to be.” 

“Very well, then, tell me what happened while you were 
out of the room.” 

To everyone's astonishment, the Mulla repeated a long 
and involved story that the King had been reciting. 

“How did you do it, Nasrudin?” 

“Simple,” said the Mulla; “I could tell by the expression 
on the face of the King that he was about to tell that 
old story again. That is why I went to sleep for its dura¬ 
tion.” 

Nasrudin and his wife are presented in the next story as 
two ordinary people, who are man and wife, yet separated 



p6 the sueis 

in understanding of each other by the fact that ordinary 
human communication is faulty and insincere. The com¬ 
munication between Sufis is of a different order. Further, 
it is hopeless to try to use the crudity and dishonesty of ordi¬ 
nary communication for mystical purposes. At least, the 
various methods of communication are combined by Sufis to 
produce an altogether different signaling system. 

The Mullah wife was angry with him. She accordingly 
brought hiTn his soup boiling hot, and did not warn him 
that it might scald him. 

But she was hungry herself, and as soon as the soup was 
served, she took a gulp of it Tears of pain came to her eyes. 
But she still hoped that the Mulla would bum himself. 

“My dear, what is the matter?” asked Nasrudin. 

“I was only thinking about my poor old mother. She used 
to like this soup, when she was alive.” 

Nasrudin took a scalding mouthful from his own bowl. 

Tears coursed down his cheek. 

"Are you crying, Nasrudin?” 

“Yes, I am crying at the thought that your old mother is 
dead, poor thing; and left someone like you in the land of 
the living.” 

Seen from the standpoint of reality, which is the Sufi one, 
other metaphysical systems contain several severe drawbacks, 
some of which are worth considering. What a mystic has to 
say of his experiences, when reported in words, always con¬ 
stitutes a nearly useless distortion of fact Furthermore, this 
distortion can be repeated by others impressively enough to 
appear profound; but it has in itself no illuminative value. 
For the Sufi, mysticism is not a matter of going somewhere 
and gaining enlightenment, and then trying to express 
something of it. It is an undertaking which correlates with 
his very being and produces a link between all humanity 
and the extra dimension of understanding. 

All these points—and several more—are made concurrently 
in one of the Nasrudin tales: 

The Mulla had returned to his village from the imperial 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 97 

capital, and the villagers gathered around to hear what he 
had to say of his adventures. 

“At this time,” said Nasrudin, “I only want to say that the 
King spoke to me.” 

There was a gasp of excitement. A citizen of their vil¬ 
lage had actually been spoken to by the King! The titbit 
was more than enough for the yokels. They dispersed to pass 
on the wonderful news. 

But the least sophisticated of all hung back, and asked 
the Mulla exactly what the King had said. 

“What he said—quite distinctly, mind you, for anyone 
to hear—was ‘Get out of my way!* ” 

The simpleton was more than satisfied. His heart ex¬ 
panded with joy. Had he not, after all, heard words actually 
used by the King; and seen the man to whom they had 
been addressed? 

The story is popularly current among the folk tales of 
Nasrudin, and its obvious moral is aimed against name 
droppers. But the Sufic meaning is important in preparing 
the dervish mind for the experiences which replace super¬ 
ficial ones like this. 

It is more than interesting to observe the effect of Nasru¬ 
din tales upon people in general. Those who prefer the more 
ordinary emotions of life will cling to their obvious mean¬ 
ing, and insist upon treating them as jokes. These include 
the people who compile or read small booklets of the more 
obvious jests, and who show visible uneasiness when the 
metaphysical or “upsetting” stories are told them. 

Nasrudin himself answers these people in one of his short¬ 
est jokes: 

“They say your jokes are full of hidden meanings, Nas¬ 
rudin. Are they?” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I have never told the truth in my life, even 
once; neither will I ever be able to do so.” 

The ordinary individual may say, with a sense of pro- 



98 the SUFIS 

fundity, that all humor is really serious; that every jolce 
carries a message on a philosophical level. But this message 
system is not that of Nasrudin. The cynical humorist, it may 
be supposed, like the Greek philosopher, may point out ab¬ 
surdities in our thoughts and actions. This is not the role of 
Nasrudin either—because the over-all effect of Nasrudin 
is some thin g more profound. Since the Mulla stories all have 
a coherent relationship with one another and with a form of 
reality which the Sufi is teaching, the cycle is a part of a con¬ 
text of conscious development which cannot be correctly 
related to the snipping of the ordinary humorist or the 
sporadic satiricism of the formal thinker. 

When a Nasrudin tale is read and disgested, something 
is happening. It is this consciousness of happening and con¬ 
tinuity which is central to Sufism. 

In reply to the question, “What method lacks Sufism?” 
Khoja Anis said, “Without continuity, there is no Sufism; 
without being and becoming, there is no Sufism; without 
interrelation, there is no Sufism.” 

This truth is to an extent transmitted by words. Better 
still, it is partially conveyed by the mutual action of the 
words and the reaction of the hearer. But the Sufi experience 
comes by means of a mechanism which takes over at the 
point where words leave off—the point of action, of “work¬ 
ing with” a master. 

Nasrudin once illustrated this in his famous “Chinese” 
story. He had gone to China, where he gathered a circle of 
disciples, whom he was preparing for enlightenment. Those 
who became illuminated immediately ceased attending his 
lectures. 

A party of his undeveloped followers, desiring more il¬ 
lumination, traveled from Persia to China to continue their 
studies with him. 

After their first lecture, he received them. 

“Why, Mulla,” one of them asked, “do you lecture on 
secret words which we (unlike the Chinese) can under¬ 
stand? They are namidanam and hichmalumnistl They 



the subtleties of mulla nasrudin 99 

mean, in Persian, merely 1 don't know' and Nobody 
knows.'” 

^What would you have me do instead—lie my head off?” 
asked Nasrudin. 

Sufis use technical terms to render an approximate equiv¬ 
alent of mysteries which are experiences not to be verbalized. 
Until the Seeker is ready to “catch” the experience, he is 
protected from making the mistake of trying to investigate 
it intellectually by the very use of these techni cali ties. It¬ 
self the result of conscious specialization, Sufism has dis¬ 
covered that there is no short cut to enlightenment This 
does not mean that the enlightenment may take a long time. 
It does mean that the Sufi must stick to the Path. 

Nasrudin, playing the part of the man who seeks a short 
cut, figures in a joke which conveys this idea: 

It was a wonderful morning, and the Mulla was walking 
home. Why, he thought to himself, should he not take a short 
cut through the beautiful woodland beside the dusty road? 

“A day of days, a day for fortunate pursuits!” he exclaimed 
to himself, plunging into the greenery. 

Almost at once, he found himself lying at the bottom of 
a concealed pit. 

Tt is just as well I took this short cut,” he reflected, as he 
lay there; ^because if things like this can happen in the 
midst of such beauty—what catastrophe might not have 
developed on that uncompromisingly tiresome highway?” 

Under somewhat similar circumstances, the Mulla was 
once seen investigating an empty nest: 

“What are you doing, Mulla?” 

“Looking for eggs.” 

' "There are no eggs in last year's nest!” 

T)ont be too sure,” said Nasrudin; “if you were a bird 
and wanted to protect your eggs, would you build a new 
nest, with everyone watching?” 

This is another of the Mulla's tales which appear in Don 
Quixote . The fact that this joke can be read in at least two 
ways might deter the formalist thinker, but provides the 



THE SUFIS 


100 

dervish with the opportunity of understanding the duality of 
real being, which is obscured by conventional human think¬ 
ing. Hence what is its absurdity to the intellectual becomes 
its strength to the intuitively perceptive. 

Contact between Sufis sometimes takes place by means of 
signs, and communication can be carried on through meth¬ 
ods which are not only unknown, but could appear incom¬ 
prehensible, to the mind conditioned in the ordinary way. 
This, of course, does not prevent the pattern-thinker from 
trying to make sense out of what seems nonsense. In the 
end he gets the wrong interpretation, though it may satisfy 
him. 

Another mystic stopped Nasrudin in the street, and 
pointed at the sky. He meant, “There is only one truth, 
which covers all.” 

Nasrudin was accompanied at the time by a scholar, who 
was seeking the rationale of Sufism. He said to himself, 
“This weird apparition is mad. Perhaps Nasrudin will take 
some precautions against him.” 

Sure enough, the Mulla rummaged in his knapsack and 
brought out a coil of rope. The scholar thought, “Excellent, 
we will be able to seize and bind up the madman if he be¬ 
comes violent” 

Nasrudin s action had, in fact, meant, “Ordinary human¬ 
ity tries to reach that "sky" by methods as unsuitable as this 
rope.” 

The “madman” laughed and walked away. ‘Well done,” 
said the scholar; “you saved us from him.” 

This story has given rise to a Persian proverb, “A question 
about the sky—the answer about a rope.” The proverb, often 
invoked by non-Sufi clerics or intellectuals, is often used in 
a contrary sense to its initiatory one. 

Knowledge cannot be attained without effort—a fact 
which is fairly generally accepted. But the ludicrous meth¬ 
ods which are used to project effort, and the absurdity of 
the efforts themselves, effectively close the gateway to knowl- 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULL A NASRUDIN 101 

edge for people who try to transfer the learning systems of 
one field into that of another. 

Yogurt is made by adding a small quantity of old yogurt 
to a larger measure of milk. The action of the bacillus 
bulgaricus in the seeding portion of yogurt will in time con¬ 
vert the whole into a mass of new yogurt. 

One day some friends saw Nasrudin down on his knees 
beside a pond. He was adding a little old yogurt to the 
water. One of the men said, &lt;f What are you trying to do, 
Nasrudin?” 

“I am trying to make yogurt.” 

“But you can’t make yogurt in that way!” 

‘Yes, I know; but just supposing it takes!” 

Almost anyone will smile at the idiocy of the ignorant 
Mulla. Some people believe that many forms of humor de¬ 
pend for their enjoyment value on the knowledge that one 
would not be as much of a fool as the person laughed at. 
Millions of people who would not try to make yogurt with 
water would attempt to penetrate esoteric thinking by 
equally futile methods. 

One tale attributed to Mulla Nasrudin goes a long way 
toward distinguishing between the mystical quest in itself 
and the form which is based upon lesser, ethical or formally 
religious criteria: 

A Chinese sage is represented as having said to Nasrudin, 
“Each person must regard his behavior as he would regard 
that of the other. You must have in your heart for the other 
what you have in your heart for yourself.” 

This is not a paraphrase of the Christian Golden Rule, 
though it contains the same sentiment. It is, in fact, a quo¬ 
tation from Confudous (born 551 B.C.). 

“This would be an astonishing remark,” replied the Mulla, 
“for anyone who paused to realize that what a man desired 
for himself is likely to be as undesirable in the end as what 
he would desire for his enemy, let alone his friend. 

‘What he must have in his heart for others is not what 
he wants for himself. It is what should be for him, and what 


102 


THE SUFIS 


should be for all. This is known only when inner truth is 
known.” 

Another version of this reply says tersely, “A bird ate 
poisonous berries, which did it no harm. One day it col¬ 
lected some for its meal, and sacrificed its lunch by feeding 
the fruit to its friend, a horse.” 

Another Sufi master, Amini of Samarkand, comments 
tersely on this theme, as did Rumi before him: "A man 
wished another man to kill him. Naturally he wished this 
for everyone else, since he was a ‘good* man. The ‘good’ 
man is, of course, the man who wants for others what he 
wants for himself. The single problem of this is that what 
he wants is often the last thing which he needs.” 

Again there is the insistence in Sufism upon the reality 
which must precede the ethic—not the ethic merely set up 
in isolation and assumed to have some sort of universal 
validity which even general consideration can show to be 
absent 

The Nasrudin stories cannot, incidentally, be read as a sys¬ 
tem of philosophy which is intended to persuade people to 
drop their beliefs and embrace its precepts. By its very con¬ 
struction, Sufism cannot be preached. It does not rely upon 
undermining other systems and offering a substitute, or a 
more plausible one. Because Sufi teaching is only partially 
expressed in words, it can never attempt to combat philo¬ 
sophical systems on their own terms. To attempt to do so 
would be to try to make Sufism accord with artificialities— 
an impossibility. By its own contention, metaphysics can¬ 
not be approached in this way; so Sufism relies upon the 
composite impact—the “scatter” dissemination. The would-be 
Sufi may be prepared or partially enlightened by Nasrudin. 
But in order to “mature” he will have to engage in the prac¬ 
tical work, and benefit from the actual presence of a master 
and of other Sufis. Anything else is referred to by the pithy 
term, “Trying to transmit a kiss by personal messenger ” It 
is a kiss, sure enough; but it is not what was intended. 

If Sufism is accepted to be the methodology whereby the 


THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN 103 

injunctions of religious teachers may be given their real 
expression, how is the would-be Sufi to find a source of 
instruction for an instructor he must have? 

The true master cannot prevent the growth and develop¬ 
ment of supposedly mystical schools which accept pupils and 
perpetuate the counterfeit version of illuminative teaching. 
Still less, if we are to see the facts objectively, is the tyro 
able to distinguish between a true and a false school. “The 
false coin exists only because there is such a thing as true 
gold,” runs the Sufi dictum—but how can the true be dis¬ 
tinguished from the false by someone who has no training 
in so doing? 

The beginner is saved from complete insensitivity because 
within him there is a vestigial capacity to react to “true 
gold." And the teacher, recognizing the innate capacity, will 
be able to use it as a receiving apparatus for his signals. 
True, in the earlier stages, the signals transmitted by the 
teacher will have to be arranged in such a way as to be per¬ 
ceptible to the inefficient and probably distorting mechanism 
of the receiver. But the combination of the two elements 
provides a basis for a working arrangement. 

At this stage the teacher marks time to a great extent. 
Several Nasrudin tales, in addition to their entertainment 
value, emphasize the initial seemingly incomplete harmony 
between the teacher and the taught which occupies a pre¬ 
paratory period: 

A number of would-be disciples came to the Mulla one 
day and asked him to give them a lecture. “Very well," he 
said, “follow me to the lecture hall." 

Obediently they lined up behind Nasrudin, who mounted 
his donkey back to front, and moved off. At first the youths 
were confused, later they remembered that they should not 
question even the slightest action of a teacher. Finally they 
could not bear the jeers of the ordinary passers-by. 

Sensing their unease, the Mulla stopped and stared at 
them. The boldest of them all approached him.

“Mulla, we do not quite understand why you are riding 
that donkey face to tail.” 

“Quite simple,” said the Mulla. “You see, if you were to 
walk in front of me, this would be disrespect to me. On the 
other hand, if I had my back to you, it would mean dis¬ 
respect toward you. This is the sole possible compromise.” 

To someone whose perception is sharpened, more than 
one dimension of this and other stories becomes apparent. 
The net effect of experiencing a tale at several different 
levels at once is to awaken the innate capacity for under¬ 
standing on a comprehensive, more objective manner than 
is possible to the ordinary, painstaking and inefficient way 
of thinking. The Sufi, for instance, sees in this story, at 
one and the same time, messages and linkages with the 
other sphere of being which not only help him on his way 
but also give him positive information. To a small extent 
the ordinary thinker may be able to experience (mutatis 
mutandis ) the different perspectives by considering them 
separately. For instance, Nasrudin is able to observe the 
pupils by sitting back to front. He is unconcerned as to what 
other people will think of him, while the undeveloped stu¬ 
dents are still sensitive to public (and uninformed) opinion. 
He may be sitting back to front, but he is still mounted, 
while they are not. Nasrudin, in violating the ordinary con¬ 
ventions, even making himself appear ridiculous, is stating 
that he is different from the average person. Since, too, he 
has been along that path before, he does not need to face 
forward, to look where he is going. Again, in that position, 
uncomfortable by average standards, he is able to keep his 
equilibrium. He is, again, teaching by doing and being, not 
by words. 

Such considerations, transposed into the field of meta¬ 
physics and then experienced concurrently, provide the total 
yet composite impact of the Nasrudin story upon the pro¬ 
gressing mystic. 

Nasrudin's guile, made necessary by the need to slip 
through the mesh which has been arranged by the Old 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN I05 

Villain, appears in one story after another. His seeming mad¬ 
ness is characteristic of the Sufi, whose actions may be in¬ 
explicable and appear mad to the onlooker. In story after 
story he stresses the Sufi assertion that nothing can be had 
without paying for it. This paying may take one of many 
forms of sacrifice—of cherished ideas, of money, of ways of 
doing things. This latter point is essential because the Sufi 
quest is impossible if the areas employed in the journey are 
already occupied by elements which prevent the journey 
being pursued. 

And yet, in the end, Nasrudin gets away scot-free. This 
indicates the fact that although deprivation in the early 
stages of Sufism may appear to be "paying,” in the true sense 
the Seeker does not pay at all. He does not pay, that is to 
say, anything of ultimate worth. 

The Sufi attitude toward money is a special one, far re¬ 
moved from the shallower, philosophical or theological as¬ 
sumption that money is the root of evil, or that faith is in 
some way opposed to money. 

One day Nasrudin asked a wealthy man for some money. 

&lt;f What do you want it for?” 

"To buy an elephant.” 

"If you have no money you will not be able to maintain 
an elephant.” 

"I asked for money , not advice!” 

The link here is with the elephant in the dark. Nasrudin 
needs money for the "work.” The rich man, Nasrudin real¬ 
izes, cannot readjust his ideas to see how the money would 
be spent; he would need a plausible scheme of finance to be 
put before him. Nasrudin uses the Sufi word "elephant” to 
stress this. Naturally the rich man does not understand. 

Nasrudin is poor; the word being the same one which is 
used by Sufis to denote one of their number—Fakir. When 
he does in fact obtain money, he does so by a method, and 
uses it in a way which is incomprehensible to the formalist 
thinker: 



THE SUFIS 


106 

One day the Mulla's wife was upbraiding him for being 
poor. 

“If you are a man of religion,” she said, “you should pray 
for money. If that is your employment, you should be paid 
for it, just as anyone else is paid.” 

“Very well, I shall do just that.” 

Going into the garden, Nasrudin shouted at the top of his 
voice, “O God! I have served you all these years without 
financial gain. My wife now says that I should be paid. May 
I therefore, and at once, have a hundred gold pieces of my 
outstanding salary?” 

A miser who lived in the next house was at that moment 
on his roof counting his riches. Thinking that he would 
make a fool of Nasrudin, he threw down in front of him a 
bag containing exactly a hundred golden dinars. 

“Thank you,” said Nasrudin, and hurried into the house. 

He showed the coins to his wife, who was very impressed. 

“Forgive me,” she said, “I never really believed that you 
were a saint, but I now see that you are.” 

During the next day or two, the neighbor saw all man¬ 
ner of luxuries being delivered at the Mulla’s house. He 
began to grow restive. He presented himself at Nasrudin’s 
door. 

“Know, fellow,” said the Mulla, “I am a saint. What do 
you want?” 

“I want my money back. I threw down that bag of gold, 
not God.” 

“You may have been the instrument , but the gold did not 
come as a result of my asking you for it.” 

The miser was beside himself. “I shall take you at once 
to the magistrate, and we will have justice.” 

Nasrudin agreed. As soon as they were outside, Nasrudin 
said to the miser, “I am dressed in rags. If I appear beside 
you before the magistrate, the disparity of our appearances 
may well prejudice the court in your favor.” 

“Very well,” snarled the miser, “take my robe and I will 
wear yours.” 


THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN I07 

They had gone a few yards farther when Nasrudin said, 
“You are riding and I am on foot. If we appear like this be¬ 
fore the magistrate he may well think that he should give 
the verdict to you." 

know who is going to win this case, no matter what he 
looks like! You ride on my horse." 

Nasrudin mounted the horse, while his neighbor walked 
behind. 

When their turn came, the miser explained what had hap¬ 
pened to the judge. 

“And what have you got to say to this charge?" the judge 
asked of the Mulla. 

‘Tour honor. This man is a miser, and he is also suffering 
from delusions. He has the illusion that he gave me the 
money. In true reality, it came from a higher source. It 
merely appeared to this man to have been given by him." 

“But how can you prove that?" 

“There is nothing simpler. His obsessions take the form 
of thinking that things belong to him when they do not 
Just ask him to whom this robe belongs. . . ." Nasrudin 
paused and fingered the robe which he was wearing. 

“That is mine!" shouted the miser. 

“Now," said Nasrudin; “ask him whose horse I was riding 
when I came to this court . . ." 

“You were riding my horse!" screamed the plaintiff. 

“Case dismissed," said the judge. 

Money is looked upon by the Sufis as an active factor in 
the relationship between people, and between people and 
their environment Since the ordinary perception of reality 
is shortsighted, it is not surprising that the normal human 
use of money is equally limited in perspective. The joke 
about the frogs in the Nasrudin collection explains some¬ 
thing of this flavor: 

A passer-by saw Nasrudin throwing money into a pool, 
and asked him why he was doing it 

“I was on my donkey. He had slipped and was slithering 
down the side of this pool, about to overbalance and fall. 



THE SUFIS 


108 

There seemed no hope that either of us would survive a 
serious fall. Suddenly the frogs in the water began to croak. 
This frightened the donkey. He reared up and by this means 
he was able to save himself. 

“Should the frogs not benefit from having saved our 
lives?” 

Whereas on the ordinary plane this joke is taken to show 
Nasrudin as a fool, the deeper meanings are direct reflections 
of Sufi financial attitudes. The frogs represent people, who 
cannot use money. Nasrudin rewards them because of the 
general rule that a reward follows a good action. That the 
croaking of the frogs was accidental, seemingly, is another 
factor to ponder. In one respect, at least, the frogs were less 
blameworthy than ordinary people would be. They probably 
did not think that they were capable of using money, cor¬ 
rectly or otherwise. This story is also used in the sense of 
“casting pearls before swine,” in answer to a questioner who 
asked a Sufi why he did not make his knowledge and wis¬ 
dom available to all and sundry, and especially to people 
who (like the frogs) had showed him kindness and what 
they thought to be understanding. 

In order to understand the wider aspects of Sufi thought, 
and before progress can be made along lines outside the web 
cast over humanity by the Old Villain, the dimensions pro¬ 
vided by Nasrudin must be visited. If Nasrudin is like a 
Chinese box, with compartment within compartment, at 
least he offers numerous simple points of entry into a new 
way of thinking. To be familiar with the experience of 
Nasrudin is to be able to unlock many doors in the more 
baffling texts and practices of the Sufis. 

As one’s perceptions increase, so does the power of ex¬ 
tracting nutrition from the Nasrudin tales. They provide 
for the beginner what the Sufis call a “blow”—calculated im¬ 
pact which operates in a special way, preparing the mind 
for the Sufi undertaking. 

Looked upon as nutrition, the Nasrudin blow is called a 



THE SUBTLETIES OF MULLA NASRUDIN I09 

coconut. This term is derived from a Sufi statement: “A 
monkey threw a coconut from a treetop at a hungry Sufi, 
and it hit him on the leg. He picked it up; drank the milk; 
ate the flesh; made a bowl from the shell.” 

In one sense, they fulfill the function of the literal blow 
which occurs in one of the most terse of the Mulla tales: 

Nasrudin handed a boy a pitcher, told him to fetch water 
from a well, and gave him a clout on the ear. “And mind 
you don’t drop it!” he shouted. 

An onlooker said, “How can you strike someone who has 
done nothing wrong?” 

“I suppose,” said Nasrudin, “that you would prefer me to 
strike him after he has broken the pitcher, when the pitcher 
and water are both lost? In my way the boy remembers, and 
the pot and contents are also saved.” 

Since Sufism is a comprehensive work, it is not only the 
Seeker who must leam, like the boy. The work, like the 
pitcher and the water, has its own rules, outside the mun¬ 
dane methods of arts and sciences. 

Nobody can set off on the Sufi path unless he has the 
potentiality for it If he tries to do so, the possibilities of 
error are too great for him to have a chance of bringing 
back the water without breaking the pot. 

Sometimes Nasrudin stories are arranged in the form of 
aphorisms, of which the following are examples: 

It is not in fact so. 

Truth is something which I never speak. 

I do not answer all the questions; only those which the 
know-alls secretly ask themselves. 

If your donkey allows someone to steal your coat—steal his 
saddle. 

A sample is a sample. Yet nobody would buy my house 
when I showed them a brick from it. 

People clamor to taste my vintage vinegar. But it would 
not be forty years old if I let them, would it? 

To save money, I made my donkey go without food. Un-

fortunately the experiment was interrupted by its death. It

Sheikh Saadi of Shiraz 


He who sleeps on the Road will lose either 
his hat or his head. 

(Nizami, Treasury of Mysteries ) 


The Gulistan (Rose Garden) and Bustan (Orchard) of 
Saadi of Shiraz (1184-1291) are two classics of Sufism 
which provide the moral and ethical basis of the reading 
of millions, in India, Persia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and 
Central Asia. Saadi was at times a wandering dervish, was 
captured by the Crusaders and made to dig ditches until 
ransomed; visited the centers of learning of the East and 
wrote poetry and literature which has not been surpassed. 
He was educated in Baghdad at the great college founded 
by Nizam, the friend of Khayyam and Minister of Court of 
the Shah. His affiliation was with the Naqshbandi Order 
of Sufis, and he was closely associated with Sheikh Shaha- 
budin Suhrawardi, the founder of the Suhrawardi School, 
and also Najmuddin Kubra, the “Pillar of the Age,” one 
of the greatest Sufis of all time. 

Saadi’s influence upon European literature is acknowl- 
edgedly very considerable. He is one of the group whose 
writings gave substance to the Gesta Romanorum, source 
book for many Western legends and allegories. Scholars 


112 


THE SUFIS 


have traced many of Saadi’s influences in literature such 
as that of Germany. Translations of his works are first found 
in the West in the seventeenth century. like most other 
Sufi work, however, the interior meaning of Saadi is hardly 
known at all through his literary interpreters. A typical com¬ 
ment by a recent commentator shows this clearly. It is not 
so much an opinion of Saadi as an indication of the mind 
of the author: "It is exceedingly doubtful whether he was 
a Sufi by temperament. In him the didactic subordinates the 
mystic." 

In actual fact, the cautionary tales, rhymes, soulful anal¬ 
ogies used by Saadi are multifunctional. On the ordinary 
level they do indeed contribute toward the ordinary stabiliza¬ 
tion of ethic. But Professor Codrington almost alone among 
Western commentators sees deeper: 

"The allegory in the Gulistan is particular to Sufis. They 
cannot give their secrets to those who are unprepared to 
receive or interpret them correctly, so they have developed a 
special terminology to convey these secrets to initiates. Where 
no words exist to convey such thoughts, special phrases or 
allegories are used." 

It is not in the West alone that people expect esoteric 
knowledge to be handed to them upon a plate. Saadi him¬ 
self points this out in one of his stories. 

He was traveling with some devout companions toward 
the Hejaz in Arabia. A boy near Beni Hilal Oasis started 
to sing in such a way that the camel of a scoffer of mysti¬ 
cism began to dance, then ran off into the desert. "I com¬ 
mented," says the Sheikh, " 'good Sir, you remain unmoved, 
but that song has affected even an animal/ 

His teaching about self-examination refers not only to 
the ordinary need to practice what one preaches. On the 
Sufi Way there must be a certain kind of self-examination. 
This comes at a stage earlier than that at which one can 
understand the admonitions of a teacher. "If you will not

tion CMS). 



SHEIKH SAADI OF SHIRAZ 113 

reprove yourself,” Saadi says, 'you will not welcome reproof 
from another.” 

Such is the persistence of mechanical adulation of the 
retired life that a candidate for Sufi studies must first be 
informed as to the place of retirement. "Fettered feet in the 
presence of friends is better than living in a garden with 
strangers,” he remarks. Only under certain circumstances is 
withdrawal from the world needed. Anchorites, who are 
nothing more than professional obsessives, have given the 
impression that the desert or mountains are the places where 
the mystic must spend his whole life. They have mistaken 
a thread for the whole carpet. 

The importance of time and place in Sufi exercises is 
another matter which Saadi stresses. Ordinary intellectuals 
will be unable to believe that thought varies in quality and 
effectiveness in accordance with circumstances. They will 
plan a meeting for a certain time and place, will start an 
academic conversation and keep it going under any cir¬ 
cumstances, insensitive to the Sufi cognition that only on 
"occasion,” according to the Sufi, can the human mind es¬ 
cape from the machine within which it revolves. 

This principle, familiar in ordinary life under the guise of 
"There is a time and a place for everything,” is stressed by 
the Gulistan in a typical manner. Tale thirty-six of the chap¬ 
ter on the manners of dervishes seems to be a mere exercise 
in moral instruction or etiquette. When expounded in the 
Sufi atmosphere, it reveals fresh dimensions. 

A dervish entered a house of a generous man, and found 
an assembly of literati there. There was a constant inter¬ 
change of pleasantries and the air was thick with the results 
of intellectual exercise. Someone invited him to contribute. 
"You must accept from a smaller intellect only one couplet,” 
said the dervish. The company implored him to speak. 

Like a bachelor before the women’s bathhouse 
door, I face the table, hungry for food. 

The couplet means not only that this was a time for food, 


THE SUFIS

not talk; it also conveys that the intellectual prattling was 
merely a setting for real understanding. 

The story continues that the host at once said that very 
soon meatballs would be provided. “For the starving man,” 
replied the dervish, “plain bread is meatball enough.” 

Those who are impatient to learn without knowing that 
they are not fitted for learning Sufism in their crude state 
are often reprimanded by the Gulistcm, in stories and poetry, 
“How can the sleeper arouse the sleeper?” Saadi asks in a 
familiar Sufi phrase. While it may be true that a man's 
actions should accord with his words, it is also most true that 
the observer himself must be in a position to assess these 
actions. Most people are not. “A conference of the wise is 
like the bazaar of the clothsellers. In the latter place you 
cannot take away anything unless you pay money. In the 
former, you can only carry away that for which you have the 
capacity.” 2 

The selfishness of the would-be disciple in seeking his 
own development and interests is another subject that is 
stressed among the Sufis. A balance has to be struck between 
wanting something for oneself and wanting it for the com¬ 
munity as well. The link between the Sufis and the Brethren 
of Sincerity, hardly noticed by outside observers, is stressed 
in Saadi's section on this problem. The Brethren were a 
society of savants who prepared recensions of available 
knowledge and published them anonymously, in the cause 
of education, none desirous of increasing his own repute 
through this dedication. Because they were a secret society, 
little was known about them; because “sincerity” is associated 
with the Sufis, Sufi teachers were often asked about them. 
Saadi gives this lesson about the mysterious Brethren in 
tale forty-three: 

A wise man was asked about the Brethren of Sincerity. He 
said, “Even the least among them honors the wishes of his 

2 “Many a ‘learned’ man is destroyed by ignorance and by the 
learning which is of no use to him.” (Hadrat Ahmed ibn Mahsud, 
the Sufi) 



SHEIKH SAADI OF SHIRAZ 115 

companions above his own. As the wise say: *A man en¬ 
grossed in himself is neither brother nor kinsman/ ” 

The place won by the Gulistan as a book of moral uplift 
invariably given to the literate young has had the effect of 
establishing a basic Sufic potential in the minds of its 
readers. Saadi is read, and enjoyed, because of his thoughts, 
his poems, the entertainment value of his books. In later 
years, when he comes to be affiliated to a Sufi teaching 
school, the inner dimensions of the tales can be revealed to 
the student. He has something upon which to build. This 
preparatory material is almost nonexistent in other cultures. 

Secrets revealed prematurely—and there are some in 
Sufism which can actually be communicated without the 
whole of the teaching—can cause more harm than good. Un¬ 
less the recipient is prepared, he can misuse the power of 
which the Sufis are guardians. Saadi explains this in a story 
which, overtly, is little more than the amplification of a well- 
worn proverb: 

A man had an ugly daughter. He married her to a blind 
man because nobody else would have her. A doctor offered 
to restore the blind man's sight. But the father would not 
allow him, for fear that he would divorce his daughter. “The 
husband of an ugly woman," concludes Saadi, “is best 
blind." 

Generosity and liberality are two of the important factors 
which, when applied energetically and correctly, go to pre¬ 
pare the candidate for Sufihood. When it is said, “You get 
nothing free," there is very much more to it than that. The 
manner of giving, the thing which is given, the effect of the 
giving upon the individual—these are the factors which de¬ 
termine the progress of the Sufi. There is a strong link be¬ 
tween the concept of persistence and bravery with that of 
liberality. In ordinary discipleship as known in other sys¬ 
tems, where the inner understanding of the mechanism of 
progress is in disarray, the disciple will think in terms of 
struggle. He gets nothing without struggle, he thinks; and 
he is encouraged to think in this way. 


But Saadi pinpoints the problem in one of his smaller 
aphorisms. A person, he says, went to a sage and asked 
whether it was better to be valorous or liberal. He answered, 
“He who is liberal does not have to be valorous." This is a 
most important aspect of Sufi training. It will also be 
noticed that the form in which the teaching is couched 
gives Saadi the extra possibility of pointing out (through the 
mouth of the sage) that questions put in a certain way— 
either/or—are not necessarily to be answered in that way. 

In his chapter on the advantages of contentment, 
Saadi conceals Sufi teachings in several stories which are 
seemingly aimed at those who do not exercise correct eti¬ 
quette. A number of dervishes, reduced to an extremity of 
hunger, wanted to accept some food from an evil man, 
known for his liberality. Saadi himself advises them, in a fa¬ 
mous poem: 

The lion does not eat the dog’s leavings 

Though he die of hunger in his lair. 

Resign your bodies to starvation: 

Do not beg the base for favors. 

The way and position in which this story is given shows 
to the Sufi that Saadi is warning against the dervish follow¬ 
ing any attractive creed outside of his own, while he is in a 
period of trial consequent upon his Sufi dedication. 

The real Sufi has something within him which cannot be 
reduced in value by association with lesser men. Saadi has 
made this theme most attractive in one of his elegant moral 
tales, showing where real dignity resides: 

A king was hunting in a wilderness with some courtiers 
when it became very cold. He announced that they would 
sleep in a peasant’s hovel until morning. The courtiers in¬ 
sisted that the monarch’s dignity would suffer if he were to 
enter such a place. The peasant, however, said, “It is not 
your Majesty who will lose; but I who will gain in dignity 
from being so honored." The peasant received a robe of 
honor. 



Fariduddin Attar, the Chemist 


A monkey saw a cherry through the clear glass of a bottle, 
and thought he would take it. Passing his hand into the 
neck of the bottle, he closed his fist over the cherry. Now he 
found that he could not withdraw his hand. The hunter, 
who had set this trap, now came along. The monkey, im¬ 
possibly hampered by the bottle, could not run away, and 
he was caught. “At least I have the cherry in my hand,” 
he thought. At that moment the hunter gave him a sharp 
tap on the elbow. The monkey's hand opened, and came 
out of the bottle. The hunter now had the fruit, the bottle 
and the monkey. 

QBook of Amu-Daria ) 


“To abandon something because others have misused it may 
be the height of folly; the Sufic truth cannot be encom¬ 
passed in rules and regulations, in formulas and in rituals— 
but yet it is partially present in all these things.” 

These words are attributed to Fariduddin the Chemist, a 
great illuminate and author, and an organizer of the Sufis. 
He died over a century before the birth of Chaucer, in 
whose works references to Attars Sufism are to be found. 
More than a hundred years after his death the foundation of 
the Order of the Garter showed such striking parallels with 
his initiatory Order that this can hardly be a coincidence. 

Fariduddin was born near Omar Khayyam’s beloved 
Nishapur, and his father bequeathed him a pharmacy, 
which is one reason given for his surname and Sufi style 
Attar—the Chemist. Of his life, a great many stories are told 
—some of them involving miracles, others containing his 
teachings. He wrote a hundred and fourteen works for the 
Sufis, the most important of which is undoubtedly the Par¬ 
liament of the Birds, a forerunner of Pilgrims Progress . Still 


THE SUEIS

a classic of Sufism and Persian literature alike, the Parlia¬ 
ment describes the Sufi experiences, and is itself based in 
plan on earlier Sufic quest themes. It unfolds meanings 
which become perceptible with the Sufic awakening of the 
mind. 

The story of Attar’s conversion, which the Sufis use to il¬ 
lustrate the need for balance between material and meta¬ 
physical things, is given by Daulat-Shah, in the classic Mem¬ 
oirs of the Poets. It is not accepted as literal reporting, but al¬ 
legorical* Attar was in his shop one day, among his numer¬ 
ous and varied merchandise, when a wandering Sufi ap¬ 
peared at the door, gazing in with his eyes filled with tears. 
Fariduddin at once told the man to be gone. “It is not dif¬ 
ficult for me/’ replied the traveler* “I have nothing to carry; 
nothing but this cloak. But you, you with your costly drugs? 
You would do well to consider your own arrangements for 
going on your way.” 

This impact so profoundly impressed Attar that he re¬ 
nounced his shop and his work, and withdrew into a Sufi 
settlement for a period of religious retreat under the aegis of 
the master Sheikh Ruknuddin. While a great deal is made 
of his aesthetic practices, he himself maintained the impor¬ 
tance of the body, even saying, “The body is not different 
from the soul, for it is a part of it; and both are a part of the 
Whole.” His teachings are not only embodied in his poetical 
works, but also in the traditional rituals which are believed 
by Sufis to be a part of them. Reference to this will be made 
later; it is the sphere where Sufic poetry, teaching and 
"work” (jamal) coincide. 

Attar was one of the Sufis most deeply versed in the biog¬ 
raphies of the earlier historical Sufis, and his only prose 
work , Memoirs of the Friends (or Recital of the Saints') 7 is 
devoted to a collection of these lives. It was on his wander¬ 
ings to Mecca and elsewhere after he quit the Sufi circle 
of Ruknuddin that he decided to make the collection. 

In his old age Attar was visited by the young Jalaluddin 
Rumi, and he presented him with one of his books. Rumi 



FARIDUDDIN ATTAR, THE CHEMIST II9 

made more public the initiatory aspects of the Sufic lore 
which Attar pursued. Later he was to refer to him as his 
own soul: "Attar traversed the seven cities of love, and we 
have reached only a single street.” 

Attar died, as he had lived, teaching. His last action was 
deliberately calculated to make a man think for himself. 
When the barbarians under Jenghiz Khan invaded Persia 
in 1220, Attar was seized, by now a man of one hundred and 
ten years of age. One Mongol said, "Do not kill this old man; 
I will give a thousand pieces of silver as a ransom for him.” 
Attar told his captor to hold out, for he would get a better 
price from someone else. A little later another man offered 
only a quantity of straw for him. "Sell me for the straw,” 
said Attar, "for that is all that I am worth.” And he was 
slain by the infuriated Mongol. 

Attar's romantic and quest writings have been shown by 
Gardn de Tassy to resemble the Roman de la Rose, and 
belong, of course, to the direct Sufic stream of romance 
teaching which antedates its appearance in Europe. A 
romance piece which gave rise to later material on a similar 
Sufic theme was written by Majriti the C6rdoban. It is 
probable that the romance material reached Western Europe 
through Spain and southern France, rather than through 
Syria, where the Sufic compositions of this genre were well 
established. Western scholars who believe that the Grail 
legend entered Europe through the Crusaders base this 
assumption only on the Syrian sources. Syria and Andalusia, 
however, were strongly linked. The transformation of "Q” 
into "G” ( Qarael Muqaddas [Holy Recital] for Garael 
Mugaddas') is Hispano-Moorish, not Syrian. De Tassy notes 
that the Roman de la Rose has analogies with two Sufic 
streams of literature—that of the Birds and the Flowers, 
and above all with the Parliament of the Birds of Attar. The 
exact version which stimulated the versions of the Roman 
known in Europe is not, of course, available; and it is more 
than possible that the origin was a verbal one, passed on

through Sufi teaching in the widespread Sufic circles o£ 
Spain. 

The Rose of Bakawali romance in India contains much 
that throws light upon the Sufic usage of this most dynamic 
imagery. And the Parliament itself, apart from the fragmen¬ 
tary indications in Chaucer and elsewhere, was translated 
into French and published in Liege in 1653. It was also 
translated into Latin in 1678. 

In the Order of Khidhr (who is St. George and also 
Khidr, the patron saint of the Sufis, the hidden guide, 
sometimes thought to be Elias), which exists to this day, 
passages from the Mantiq ut-Tair (Parliament of the 
Birds) of Attar are quoted. This is a part of the ceremonial 
of initiation: 

The sea was asked why it was dressed in blue, the color 
of mourning, and why it became agitated as if fire made 
it boil. It answered that the blue robe spoke of the sadness 
of separation from the Beloved, “that it was the fire of Love 
which made it boil.” Yellow, continues the recital, is the 
color of gold—the alchemy of the Perfected Man, who is 
refined until he is in a sense gold. The robe of initiation 
consists of the Sufi blue mantle, with a hood, and a yellow 
band. Together these two colors when mixed make green, 
the color of initiation and nature, truth and immortality. 
The Mantiq was written about one hundred and seventy 
years before the foundation of the mysterious Order of the 
Garter, which was originally known as the Order of St. 
George. 

The Sufi Order which Attar is credited with having cre¬ 
ated, and probably developed, and which certainly carries 
the tradition of his concentrating, carries out exercises de¬ 
signed to produce and maintain the harmony of the partic¬ 
ipant with the whole of creation, and it closely resembles 
the other Orders of Sufism, the tarikas. The stages of de¬ 
velopment of a Sufi, while they may take a different se¬ 
quence in different individuals, are portrayed in the Parlia¬ 
ment of the Birds, 


121 


FAMDUDDIN ATTAR, THE CHEMIST 

The birds, who represent humanity, are called together 
by the hoopoe, the Sufi, who proposes that they should start 
on a quest to find their mysterious King. He is called Si- 
murgh, and he lives in the Mountains of Kaf. Each bird, 
after at first being excited by the prospect of having a King, 
begins to make excuses as to why he should not himself take 
part in the journey toward the hidden King. The hoopoe, 
after hearing the plea of each, replies with a tale which 
illustrates the uselessness of preferring what one has or 
might have to what one should have. The poem is full of the 
Sufi imagery, and has to be studied in detail in order to be 
properly understood. The Ring of Solomon, the nature of 
Khidr the hidden guide, anecdotes of the ancient sages, fill 
its pages. 

Eventually the hoopoe tells the birds that in the quest 
they have to traverse seven valleys. First of all is the Valley 
of the Quest, where all kinds of perils threaten, and where 
the pilgrim must renounce desires. Then comes the Valley of 
Love, the limitless area in which the Seeker is completely 
consumed by a thirst for the Beloved. Love is followed by 
the Valley of Intuitive Knowledge, in which the heart re¬ 
ceives directly the illumination of Truth and an experience 
of God. In the Valley of Detachment the traveler becomes 
liberated from desires and dependence. 

In the interchange in which the hoopoe deals with the 
nightingale, Attar exposes the uselessness of ecstatics, mystics 
who follow romance for its own sake, who intoxicate them¬ 
selves with yearnings, who indulge ecstatic experience, and 
are out of touch with human life. 

The passionate nightingale came forward, beside himself 
with fervor. In each one of his thousand varying chirrup- 
ings he gave vent to a different mystery of meaning. He 
spoke so eloquently of mysteries that all the other birds fell 
silent. 

I know the secrets of love,” he said. “Throughout the 
night I give my love call. I myself teach the secrets; and it 
is my song which is the lament of the mystic flute, and 


122 


THE SUEIS 


which the lute wails. It is I who set the Rose in motion, 
and move the hearts of lovers. Continuously I teach new 
mysteries, each moment new notes of sadness, like the 
waves of the sea. Whoever hears me loses his wits in rapture, 
contrary to his normal way. When I am long bereft of my 
love the Rose, I lament unceasingly. ... And when the 
Rose returns to the world in Summer, I open my heart to 
joy. My secrets are not known to all—but the Rose 
knows them. I think of nothing but the Rose; I wish noth¬ 
ing but the ruby Rose. 

"To reach the Simurgh, that is beyond me—the love of 
the Rose is enough for the nightingale. It is for me that 
she flowers. . . , Can the nightingale live but one night 
without the Beloved?” 

The hoopoe cried, "O laggard, busy with the mere shape 
of things! Leave off the pleasures of seductive form! The 
love of the face of the Rose has merely driven thorns into 
your heart. It is your master. However beautiful the Rose, 
the beauty vanishes in a few days. Love for something so 
perishable can only cause revulsion in the Perfected Man. 
If the Rose's smile awakens your desire, it is only to hold you 
ceaselessly in sorrow. It is she who laughs at you each Spring, 
and she does not cry—leave the Rose and the redness.” 

Commenting upon this passage, one teacher remarks that 
Attar refers not only to the ecstatic who does not take his 
mysticism further than rapture. He also means the ecstatic's 
parallel, the person who feels frequent and incomplete love, 
and who, although deeply affected by it, is not regenerated 
and altered by it to such an extent that his very being under¬ 
goes a change: "This is the fire of love which purifies, which 
is different whenever it occurs, which sears the marrow and 
makes incandescent the kernel. The ore separates from 
the matrix, and the Perfected Man emerges, altered in such 
a way that every aspect of his life is ennobled. He is not 
changed in the sense of being different; but he is completed, 
and this makes him considered powerful of men. Every 
fiber has been purified, raised to a higher state, vibrates to

note, attracts the affinity in man and woman, is loved more 
and hated more; partakes of a destiny, a portion, infinitely 
assured and recognized, indifferent to the things which af¬ 
fected him while he pursued the mere shadow of which this 
is the substance, however sublime that former experience 
may have been.” 

This teacher (Adil Alimi) warns that these sentiments 
will not appeal to all. They will be “disbelieved by the ma¬ 
terialist; attacked by the theologian; ignored by the roman¬ 
tic; avoided by the shallow; rejected by the ecstatic; be wel¬ 
comed but misunderstood by the theoretician and imitation 

understands the difference between traditionalism, ?or in¬ 
stance, and the reality of which it is a reflection. 

The fifth valley is the Valley of Unification. Now the 
Seeker understands that what seemed to him to be different 
things and ideas are, in actuality, only one. 

In the Valley of Astonishment, the traveler finds bewilder¬ 
ment and also love. He no longer understands knowledge 
in the same way as formerly. Something, which is called 
love, replaces it. 

The seventh and last valley is that of Death. This is where 
the Seeker understands the mystery, the paradox, of how an 
individual “drop can be merged with an ocean, and still 
remain meaningful. He has found his 'place.’ ” 

Fariduddin Attars pen-name is Attar, the Chemist or Per¬ 
fumer. While most historians assume that he adopted this 
descriptive word because his father had a pharmacy, the 
Sufi tradition is that “Attar” conceals an initiatory meaning.

He realizes that things, whether they be old or new, have

“Attar” is an encipherment of the concept of FTR, which 
is the message about his teaching that Fariduddin Attar 
is transmitting. 

Attar was one of the greatest Sufi teachers. Before we look 
at the implications of the FTR root in Arabic, we can re¬ 
capitulate his ideas. Sufism is a form of thinking clothed 



FARIDUDDUNT ATTAR, THE CHEMIST 125 

by Attar and his followers (including Rumi, his disciple) 
in a religious format. It is concerned with growth and the 
theme of the organic evolution of mankind. Its accomplish¬ 
ment is associated with the dawn after the dark, the break¬ 
ing of bread after a fast, and intensive physical and men¬ 
tal action, unpremeditated because a response to intuitive 
impulses. 

Does the root FTR contain (i) religious associations; (2) 
connections between Christianity and Islam—because the 
Sufis claim to be Moslems but also esoteric Christians; (3) 
the idea of speed or unpremeditated action; (4) humility; 
dervishism; (5) a strong impact (of ideas or movement, as 
applied in dervish schools for training Sufis); (6) “the 
grape”—Sufi poetic analogy for interior experience; (7) 
something which forces its way out of the bosom of nature? 

Every one of these ideas is contained in the Arabic words 
derived from the FTR root, forming a mosaic of the Sufi 
existence. We may now examine the root and its use: 

FaTaR = to cleave, to split a thing; to find out; to 
begin; to create a thing (God) 

FuTR = a mushroom (that which forces its way 
upward by cleaving) 

FaTaRa = to breakfast, to break a fast 
TaFaTTaR = to split or crack 
IYD elFiTR = the Feast of the Breaking of the 
Fast 

FiTRAT = natural disposition; religious feeling; 

the religion of Islam (submission to the 
divine will) 

FaTIR = unleavened bread; unpremeditated or 
precipitate action; haste 

FaTIRA = a small, flat cake, such as is used as a 
sacrament 
FATiR = the Creator 
FuTaiyRi = a worthless man, empty, blunt 
FuTAR = a blunt thing, like a blunt sword 


THE SUEIS 


126 

Attar is traditionally associated with having passed down 
the special Sufi exercise called "Halt!”-the Exercise of the 
Pause of Time. This takes place when the teacher, at a 
special time, calls for a complete freezing of movement by 
the students. During this "pause of time” he projects his 
baraka upon the people. Suddenly suspending all physical 
action is considered to leave the consciousness open to the 
receipt of special mental developments whose power is 
drained by muscular movement. 

FTR, strangely enough, is in the Sufi word list, developed 
into QMM. This, again encoded by the same Abjad nota¬ 
tion, produces the word QiFF—the Divine Pause. This 
"Pause” is the name given to the "Haiti” exercise, which is 
only carried out by a teaching master. 

That the FTR root means, in a secondary sense, the mush¬ 
room, gives rise to an interesting speculation. Largely due 
to the initiative of Mr. R. Gordon Wasson, it has been deter¬ 
mined that in ancient times there was (and still is in sur¬ 
prisingly many places) a widespread ecstatic cult based upon 
the eating of hallucinogenic mushrooms. 

Is the FTR root connected with a mushroom cult? It is, 
in one sense, but not the sense which one would immedi¬ 
ately assume. FTR is a mushroom, but not a hallucinogenic 
one. We have two sources for asserting this. In the first 
place, the Arabic word for a hallucinogenic fungus is from 
the root GHRB. Words derived from the GHRB root indi¬ 
cate a knowledge of the strange influence of hallucinogenic 
fungi, while the FTR words do not: 

GHaRaBa = to go away, depart, have an eye tumor 

GHaRaB = to forsake one's country, to live abroad 

GHuRB^ = the setting of a star; to be absent or 
remote 

GHaRub = to be obscure, something not well un¬ 
derstood, to become a stranger 
== to go West 


GHaRaB 



FABIDUDDIN ATTAR, THE CHEMIST 12 7 

A-GHRaB = to do or say strange or immoderate 
things; to laugh immoderately; to run 
swiftly; to go far into the country 
ISTa-GHRaB = to find a thing strange, extraordi¬ 
nary; also, to laugh to excess 
GHaRB = edge of a sword; tears; etc. 

ESH el GHuRAB = toadstool (literally, “Bread of 
the crow, of the intricate, of 
the darkness, of the strange- 
ness”) 

The second interesting evidence which indicates that the 
Sufis used the FTR root to mean the interior experience 
and not one which was induced by chemical means is con¬ 
tained in a passage from the works of the aptly named Mast 
Qalandar (literally, “intoxicated dervish”), who undoubt¬ 
edly comments upon a belief that hallucinogenic mushrooms 
might provide a mystical experience, but claims that this is 
incorrect. 

First we can look at a literal rendering of the text: 

“The Creator from the spreading of fervor and the 
essence of religious feeling thus ordered the 'juice of 
the grape* for the breakfasting of the Lovers (the Sufis), 
and in the sacramental bread of the half understanders 
he left a symbol. And this too learn and know, that the 
Sufi illuminate is far from the crack and fissure of 
deception which is distortion, and went near to that 
other (initiatory) ecstatic feeling; and was far from 
mushrooming and mushrooms of madness was far. And 
the breakfasting was of the breakfast of truths on the 
Way of uncrackedness. Finally after the spreading 
(vine) and grape came and after that its juice made 
wine, and supping (after abstinence), the Complete 
Man was made fashioned strangely by the blunt scimi¬ 
tar. But this bread is not from what they say, neither 
from beneath the tree. Truly the Truth of Creation is 
discovered and ecstasy may be solely known in this hid- 


THE SUEIS 


128 

denness of the bread of the hungry and thirsty. His 
drink is after his food. The" Creator displays as the 
Opener." 

This remarkable passage has been considered to be the 
ravings of a madman. Sheikh Mauji of the Azamia Sufis 
interprets it in a page from his Durud (Recitals): 

‘There is a certain sensation which is true fervor and 
which is associated with love. This stems from ancient 
origins, and is necessary to mankind. Signs of it remain 
in circles other than those of the Sufis, but now only 
in symbolic form—as they have the Cross but we have 
Jesus. The Seeker must remember that there are simili¬ 
tudes of feeling which are illusory and which are like 
madness, but not the madness which the Sufi means 
when he talks of madness, as the author has used to 
describe himself (Mast Qalandar). It is from this 
source, the origin of what we call a wine, from a grape, 
from a vine, the product of splitting and spreading, that 
comes the true illumination. After a period of absti¬ 
nence from wine or bread, the detachment from attach¬ 
ment, this force which is a form of Opening comes 
about. This is the nutrient which is not a food in any 
sense of being a known physical thing. . . 

The original passage, which is in more or less literary 
Persian, gives us the explanation of what it is that the “mad 
dervish" is trying to do. It harps upon a single word-root: 
and that root is FTR. No translation could possibly re¬ 
create this poetic fact, because in translation the root can¬ 
not be maintained. In English, since the derivation of “split," 
“cake," “religious experience" and so on are from different 
stems, we cannot maintain the almost eerie sense of carry¬ 
ing on one single sound. 

This is an example: “Ya baradar, Fatir ast tafattari fitrat 
wa dhati fitrat. . . ." 

In the whole passage of one hundred and eleven words, 



FARIDUDDIN ATTAR, THE CHEMIST 129 

the word derived from the three-letter root FTR occurs no 
less than twenty-three times! And many of these usages of 
the words, though not incorrect, are so unusual (because 
there is so often a conventional word more apt in such a 
context) that there is absolutely no doubt that a message is 
being conveyed to the effect that chemical hallucinogens 
derived from fungi provide an undeniable but counterfeit 
experience. 


Our Master Jalaluddin Rumi 


He is enlightened whose speech and behavior accord, who 
repudiates the ordinary connections of the world. 

(Dhu’l-Nun, the Egyptian) 


Maulana (literally, Our Master) Jalaluddin Rumi, who 
founded the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, bears out in 
his career the Eastern saying, “Giants come forth from Af¬ 
ghanistan and influence the world.” He was bom in Bac- 
tria, of a noble family, at the beginning of the thirteenth 
century. He lived and taught in Iconium (Rum) in Asia 
Minor, before the beginning of the Ottoman Empire, whose 
throne he is said to have refused. His works are written in 
Persian, and so esteemed by the Persians for their poetic, 
literary and mystical content that they are called “The 
Koran in the Pehlevi tongue”—and this in spite of their 
being opposed to the national cult of the Persians, the Shia 
faith, criticizing its exclusivism. 

Among the Arabs and the Indian and Pakistani Mos¬ 
lems, Rumi is considered to be one of the first rank of mys¬ 
tical masters—yet he states that the teachings of the Koran 
are allegorical, and that it has seven different meanings. The 
extent of Rumi's influence can hardly be calculated; though 
it can be glimpsed occasionally in the literature and thought 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI I3I 

of many schools. Even Doctor Johnson, best known for his 
unfavorable pronouncements, says of Rumi, “He makes 
plain to the Pilgrim the secrets of the Way of Unity, and 
unveils the Mysteries of the Path of Eternal Truth." 

His work was well enough known within less than a hun¬ 
dred years of his death in 1273 for Chaucer to use references 
to it in some of his works, together with material from the 
teachings of Rumi’s spiritual precursor, Attar the Chemist 
(1150-1229/30). From the numerous references to Arabian 
material which can be found in Chaucer, even a cursory 
examination shows a Sufi impact of the Rumi school of lit¬ 
erature. Chaucer’s use of the phrase, “As lions may take 
warning when a pup is punished . . ." is merely a close 
adaptation of Udhrib el-kalba wa yatd addaba el-fahdu 
(“Beat the dog and the lion will behave"), which is a secret 
phrase used by the Whirling Dervishes. Its interpretation 
depends on a play upon the words “dog" and ‘lion." Al¬ 
though written as such, in speaking the password, homo¬ 
phones are used. Instead of saying dog ( kalb ), the Sufi 
says heart Qqdb'), and in place of lion ( fahd ), fahid (the 
neglectful). The phrase now becomes: “Beat the heart (Sufi 
exercises) and the neglectful (faculties) behave (cor¬ 
rectly)." 

This is the slogan which introduces the “beating the 
heart" movements encouraged by the motions and concen¬ 
trations of the Mevlevi—Whirling—Dervishes. 

The relationship between the Canterbury Tales as an 
allegory of inner development and the Parliament of the 
Birds of Attar is another interesting item. Professor Skeat 
reminds us that, like Attar, Chaucer has thirty participants 
in his pilgrimage. Thirty pilgrims seeking the mystical bird, 
the Simurgh makes sense in Persian, because si-murgh ac¬ 
tually means “thirty birds." 1 In English, however, such a 
transposition is not possible. The number of pilgrims, made 
necessary in the Persian because of the requirements of 

1 See annotation “Simurgh.” 



THE SUFIS 


132 

rhyme, is preserved in Chaucer, deprived of double mean¬ 
ing. "The Pardoner's Tale” occurs in Attar; the pear-tree 
story is found in Book IV of the Sufi work, the Mathnawi 
of Rumi. 

Rumi's influence, both in ideas and textually, is consid¬ 
erable in the West. Since most of his work has been trans¬ 
lated into Western languages in more recent years, his im¬ 
pact has become greater. But if he is, as Professor Arberry 
calls him, "surely the greatest mystical poet in the history 
of mankind," the poetry itself in which so much of his teach¬ 
ings is couched can really only be appreciated in the orig¬ 
inal Persian. The teachings, however, and the methods 
used by the Whirling Dervishes and other Rumi-influenced 
schools, are not so elusive, providing that the way of put¬ 
ting esoteric truths is understood. 

There are three documents by means of which Rumi's 
work can be studied by the outside world. The Mathnawi-i- 
Manawi (Spiritual Couplets) is Jalaluddin's masterwork— 
six books of poetry and imagery of such power in the origi¬ 
nal that its recitation produces a strangely complex exalta¬ 
tion of the hearer's consciousness. 

It was forty-three years in the writing. It cannot exactly 
be criticized as poetry, because of the special intricacy of 
ideas, form and presentation. Those who seek conventional 
verse alone in it, as Professor Nicholson remarks, have to 
skip. And then they lose the effect of what is in fact a special 
art form, created by Rumi for the express purpose of con¬ 
veying meanings which he himself concedes have no ac¬ 
tual parallel in ordinary human experience. To ignore this 
remarkable achievement is like selecting the taste without 
the strawberry jam. 

Nicholson, overstressing the role of the exquisite poetry in 
the ocean of the Mathnawi, sometimes shows a preference 
for formal verse. 

“The Mathnawi,” he says (Introduction, Selections from 
the Diwan of Shams of Tabriz, p. xxxix), “contains a wealth 
of delightful poetry. But its readers must pick their way 



OUR MASTER JA3LALUDDIN RUMI 133 

through apologues, dialogues, interpretations of Koranic 
texts, metaphysical subtleties and moral exhortations, ere all 
at once they chance upon a passage of pure and exquisite 
song." 

To the Sufi, if not to anyone else, this hook speaks from 
a different dimension, yet a dimension which is in a way 
within his deepest self. 

like all Sufi works, the Mathnawi will vary in its effect 
upon the listener in accordance with the conditions under 
which it is studied. It contains jokes, fables, conversations, 
references to former teachers and to ecstatogenic methods— 
a phenomenal example of the method of scatter, whereby a * 
picture is built up by multiple impact to infuse into the 
mind the Sufi message. 

This message, with Rumi as with all Sufi masters, is ar¬ 
ranged partially in response to the environment in which 
he is working. He instituted dances and whirling movements 
among his disciples, it is related, because of the phlegmatic 
temperament of the people among whom he was cast. The 
so-called variation of doctrine or action prescribed by the 
various Sufi teachers is in reality nothing more than the 
application of this rule. 

In his teaching system, Rumi used explanation and mental 
drill, thought and meditation, work and play, action and 
inaction. The body-mind movements of the Whirling Der-1 
vishes, coupled with the reed-pipe music to which they were# 
performed, is the product of a special method designed to I 
bring the Seeker into affinity with the mystical current, in | 
order to be transformed by it. Everything which the unre- f 
generate man understands has a use and a meaning within ] 
the special context of Sufism which may be invisible until 
it is experienced. "Prayer,” says Rumi, "has a form, a sound * 
and a physical reality. Everything which has a word, has a 
physical equivalent. And every thought has an action.” ^ 

One of the really Sufic characteristics of Rumi is that, 
although he will uncompromisingly say the most unpopular 
thing—that the ordinary man, whatever his formal attain- 



THE SUFIS 


134 

ments, is immature in mysticism—he also gives the chance 
to almost anyone to attain progress toward the completion 
of human destiny. 

like many Sufis cast in a theological atmosphere, Rumi 
first addresses his hearers on the subject of religion. He 
stresses that the form in which ordinary, emotional religion 
is understood by organized bodies is incorrect. The Veil of 
light, which is the barrier brought about by self-righteous¬ 
ness, is more dangerous than the Veil of Darkness, produced 
in the mind by vice. Understanding can come only through 
love, not by training by means of organizational methods. 

For him, the earliest teachers of religions were right. Their 
successors, apart from a few, organized matters in such a 
way as virtually to exclude enlightenment. This attitude re¬ 
quires a new approach to the problems of religion. Rumi 
takes the whole question out of the normal channel. He is 
not prepared to submit dogma to study and argument. The 
real religion, he says, is other than people think it is. There¬ 
fore there is no virtue in examining dogma. In this world, 
he says, there is no equivalent to the things which are called 
the Throne (of God), the Book, Angels, the Day of Reck¬ 
oning. Similes are used, and they are of necessity merely a 
rough idea of something else. 

In the collection of his sayings and teachings called In 
? It What Is In It (F ihi Ma Fihi ), used as a textbook for 
Sufis, he goes even further. Mankind, he says, passes through 
three stages. In the first one, he worships anything—man, 
! woman, money, children, earth and stones. Then, when he 
has progressed a little further, he worships God. Finally, he 
does not say, T worship God,” nor T do not worship God.” 
He has passed into the last stage. 

In order to approach the Sufi Way, the Seeker must realize 
that he is, largely, a bundle of what are nowadays called 
* conditionings—fixed ideas and prejudices, automatic re¬ 
sponses sometimes which have occurred through the train¬ 
ing of others. Man is not as free as he thinks he is. The first 
step is for the individual to get away from thinking that he 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI 135 

understands, and really understand. But man has been 
taught that he can understand everything by the same proc¬ 
ess, the process of logic. This teaching has undermined him. 

“If you follow the ways in which you have been trained, 
which you may have inherited, for no other reason than 
this, you are illogical." 

The understanding of religion, and what the great reli¬ 
gious figures taught, is a part of Sufism. Sufism uses the ter¬ 
minology of ordinary religion, but in a special manner 
which has always excited the anger of the nominally devout 
To the Sufi, generally speaking, each religious teacher sym¬ 
bolizes, in his creed and especially in his life, an aspect of 
the way whose totality is Sufism. Jesus is within you, says 
Rumi; seek his aid. And then, do not seek from within 
yourself, from your Moses, the needs of a Pharaoh. 

The way in which the different religious paths are sym¬ 
bolized for the Sufi is stated by Rumi when he says that 
the path of Jesus was struggling with solitude and over¬ 
coming lustfulness. The path of Mohammed was to live 
within the community of ordinary humanity. “Go by the 
way of Mohammed," he says, 'hut if you cannot, then go 
by the Christian way." Rumi here is not by any means in¬ 
viting his hearers to embrace one or other of these religions. 
He is pointing to the ways in which the Seeker can find 
fulfillment; but fulfillment through the Sufic understanding 
of what the paths of Jesus and Mohammed were. 

Similarly, when the Sufi speaks of God, he does not mean 
the deity in the sense in which it is understood by the man 
who has been trained by the theologian. This deity is ac¬ 
cepted by some, the pious; rejected by others, the atheists. 
But it is a rejection or acceptance of something which has 
been presented by the scholastics and priesthood. The God 
of the Sufis is not involved in this controversy; because 
divinity is a matter of personal experience to the Sufi. 

All this does not mean that the Sufi is trying to take away 
the exercise of the reasoning faculty. Rumi explains that 
reason is essential; but it has a place. If you want to have 



THE SUFIS

clothes made you visit a tailor. Reason tells you which tailor 
to choose. After that, however, reason is in suspense. You 
have to repose complete trust—faith—in your tailor that he 
will complete the work correctly. Logic, says the master, 
takes the patient to the doctor. After that, he is completely 
in the hands of the physician. 

But the well-trained materialist, although he claims that 
he wants to hear what the mystic has to tell him, cannot be 
told the whole truth. He would not believe it. The truth is 
not based upon materialism any more than upon logic. Hence 
the mystic is working on a series of different planes, the 
materialist on only one. The result of their contact would 
be that the Sufi will even appear inconsistent to the materi¬ 
alist. If he says today something which he said differently 
yesterday, he will appear to be a liar. At the very least, the 
situation of being at cross-purposes will destroy any chance 
of progress in mutual understanding. 

“Those who do not understand a thing,” Rumi observes, 
“claim that it is useless. The hand and the instrument are 
as flint and steel. Strike flint with earth. Will a spark be 
made?” One of the reasons why the mystic does not preach 
publicly is that the conditioned religious man, or the ma¬ 
terialist, will not understand him: 

A king's hawk settled upon a ruin inhabited by owls. 
They decided that he had come to drive them out of their 
home and take possession of it himself. “This ruin may seem 
a prosperous place to you. To me, the better place is upon 
the arm of the King,” said the hawk. Some of the owls cried, 
“Do not believe him. He is using guile to steal our home.” 

The use of fables and illustrations like this one is very 
widespread among the Sufis; and Rumi is the master fabulist 
of their number. 

The same thought is often given by the master in many 
different forms, in order to make it penetrate the mind. 
Sufis says that an idea will enter the conditioned (veiled) 
mind only if it is so phrased as to be able to bypass the 
screen of conditionings. The fact that the non-Sufi has so 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI 137 

little in common with the Sufi means that the Sufis have to j 
use the basic elements which exist in every human being, 
and which are not entirely lulle d by any fo rxajoL.condi¬ 
tioning. And these elements are precisely those which under¬ 
lie the Sufi development. Of these the first and permanent 
one is love. Love is the factor which is to carry a man, and 
all humanity, to fulfillment: 

“Mankind has an unfulfillment, a desire, and he strug¬ 
gles to fulfill it through all kinds of enterprises and ambi¬ 
tions. But it is only in love that he can find fulfillment.” 

But love is itself a serious matter; it is something which 
keeps pace with enlightenment. Both increase together. The 
full potential fire of illumination is too powerful to be en¬ 
dured all at once: 

“The heat of a furnace may be too great for you to take 
advantage of its warming effect; while the weaker flame of a 
lamp may give you the heat which you need.” 

Everyone, when he gets to a certain stage of mere personal 
sophistication, thinks that he can find the way to enlighten¬ 
ment by himself. This is denied by Sufis, for they ask how a 
person can find something when he does not know what it 
is. “Everyone has become a gold seeker,” says Rumi, “but the 
ordinary do not know it when they see it. If you cannot 
recognize it, join a wise man.” 

The ordinary man, thinking that he is on the path of en-' 
lightenment, often sees only a reflection of it. Light may be 
reflected upon a wall; the wall is the host to the light. “Do 
not attach yourself to the brick of the wall, but seek the eter¬ 
nal original.” 

“Water needs an intermediary, a vessel, between it and 
the fire, if it is to be heated correctly.” 

How is the Seeker to set about his task of getting on the 
right path? In the first place, he should not abandon work 
and living in the world. Do not give up working, instructs 
Rumi; indeed, “the treasure which you seek derives from it.” 
This is one reason why all Sufis must have a constructive 
vocation. Work, though, is not only ordinary labor or even 







138 THE SUFIS 

socially acceptable creativity. It includes self-work, the 
alchemy whereby man becomes perfected: “Wool, through 
the presence of a man of knowledge, becomes a carpet Earth 
becomes a palace. The presence of a spiritual man creates a 
similar transformation.” 

The man of wisdom is initially the guide of the Seeker. 

’ As soon as possible this teacher dismisses the disciple, who 
becomes his own man of wisdom, and then he continues 
his self-work. False masters in Sufism, as everywhere else, 
have not been few. So the Sufis are left with the strange 
situation that whereas the false teacher may appear to be 
genuine (because he takes pains to appear what the disciple 
wants him to be), the true Sufi is often not like what the un¬ 
discriminating and untrained Seeker thinks a Sufi should be 
like. 

Rumi warns: “Judge not the Sufi to be that which you 
can see of him, my friend. How long, like a child, will you 
prefer only nuts and raisins?” 

The false teacher will pay great attention to appearance, 
and will know how to make the Seeker think that he is a 
great man, that he understands him, that he has great secrets 
to reveal. The Sufi has secrets, but he must make them 
develop within the disciple. Sufism is something which hap¬ 
pens to a person, not something which is given to him. The 
'false teacher will keep his followers around him all the time, 
will not tell them that they are being given a training which 
must end as soon as possible, so that they may taste their 
development themselves and carry on as fulfilled people. 

Rumi calls upon the scholastic, the theologian, and the 
follower of the false teacher: “When will you cease to wor¬ 
ship and to love the pitcher? When will you begin to look 
for the water?” Externals are the things which people usually 
judge by. “Know the difference between the color of the 
wine and the color of the glass.” 

The Sufi must follow all the routines of self-development; 
otherwise mere concentration upon one will cause an im¬ 
balance, leading to loss. The speed of development of dif- 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI 139 

ferent people varies. Some, says Rumi, understand all from 
reading a line. Others, who have actually been present at 
an event, know all about it The capacity for understanding 
develops with the spiritual progress of the individual. 

The meditations of Rumi include some remarkable ideas, 
designed to bring the Seeker into an understanding of the 
fact that he is temporarily out of contact with complete 
reality, even though ordinary life seems to be the totality of 
reality itself. What we see, feel and experience in ordinary, 
unfulfilled life, according to Sufic thinking, is only a part 
of the great whole. There are dimensions which we can 
reach only through effort Like the submerged portion of 
the iceberg, they are there, though unperceived under ordi¬ 
nary conditions. Also like the iceberg, they are far greater 
than could be suspected by superficial study. 

Rumi uses several analogies to explain this. One of the 
most striking is his theory of action. There is, he says, such 
a thing as comprehensive action, and there is also individual 
action. We are accustomed to seeing, in the ordinary world 
of sense, only individual action. Supposing a number of 
people are making a tent. Some sew, others prepare the 
ropes, some again weave. They are all taking part in a 
comprehensive action, although each is absorbed in his in¬ 
dividual action. If we are thinking about the making of 
the tent, it is the comprehensive action of the whole group 
which is important. 

In certain directions, the Sufi says, life must be looked 
upon as a whole, as well as individually. This getting into 
tune with the whole plan, the comprehensive action of life, 
is essential to enlightenment 

Little by little, as his experiences increase, the Sufi begins 
to reshape his thinking along these lines. Before he had 
actual experience of mysticism, he was either a scoffer, un¬ 
committed, or had a completely illusory idea of the nature 
of the experience, and especially of the teacher and the 
path. Rumi gives him meditations designed to overcome the 
overdevelopment of certain ideas which are current among 



THE SUFIS

the uninstructed. Man expects to be given a golden key. 
But some are faster than others in developing. A man travel¬ 
ing through the darkness is yet traveling. The disciple is 
learning when he does not know that he is learning, and 
as a result he may well chafe. In winter, Rumi reminds 
him, a tree is collecting nutriment. People may think that 
it is idle, because they do not see anything happening. But 
in spring they see the buds. Now, they think, it is working. 
There is a time for collecting, and a time for releasing. 
This brings the subject back to the teaching: "Enlighten¬ 
ment must come little by little—otherwise it would over¬ 
whelm.” 

The tools of scholasticism, used sparingly by Sufis, are 
being replaced by esoteric training, and this has to be done 
in accordance with the capacities of the student. The tools 
of the goldsmith, our teacher remarks, in the hands of the 
cobbler are like seeds sown in sand. And the cobbler’s tools 
in the farmer’s hand are like straw offered to a dog, or bones 
to a donkey. 

The attitude toward ordinary conventions of life under¬ 
goes an examination. The question of humanity’s inner 
yearnings is seen, not as a Freudian need, but as a natural 
instrument inherent in the mind in order to enable it to 
attain to truth. People, Rumi teaches, do not really know 
what they want. Their inner yearning is expressed in a 
hundred desires which they think are their needs. These 
are not their real desires, as experience shows. For when 
these objectives are attained, the yearning is not stilled. 
Rumi would have seen Freud as someone who was obsessed 
by one of the secondary manifestations of the great yearn¬ 
ing; not as someone who had discovered the basis of the 
yearning. 

Again, people may appear evil in one’s eyes—and yet to 
another individual they may seem fair. This is because in 
the one mind there is the idea of unpleasantness, in the 
other, the concept of goodness. “The fish and the hook are 
both present together.” 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI I 4 I 

The Sufi is learning the power of detachment, to he fol¬ 
lowed by the power of experiencing what he is consider¬ 
ing, not just looking at it. In order to do this, he is instructed 
by the teacher to meditate upon Rumi's theme: “The 
satiated man and the hungry one do not see the same thing 
when they look upon a loaf of bread.” 

If a person is so untrained that he is influenced by his 
own bias, he cannot hope to make much progress. Rumi 
concentrates upon developing control; control through ex¬ 
perience, not through mere theory as to what is good or 
bad, right or wrong. This belongs to the category of words: 
“Words, in themselves, are of no importance. You treat a 
visitor well, and speak a few kind words to him. He is 
happy. But if you treat another man to a few words of 
abuse, he will be hurt. Can a few words really mean hap¬ 
piness or sadness? These are secondary factors, and not 
real ones. They affect people who are weak.” 

The Sufi learner is developing through his exercises a 
new way of seeing things. He is also acting, reacting, dif¬ 
ferently in a given situation than he otherwise would. He 
understands the deeper meaning of such recommendations 
as this: “Take the pearl, not the shell. You will not find a 
pearl in every shell, A mountain is many times larger than 
a ruby.” What seems almost trite to the ordinary man, per¬ 
haps passed on as a wise saw, becomes intensely meaning¬ 
ful to the Sufi, who finds in its depths contact with some¬ 
thing that he calls “other”—the underlying factor which he 
is seeking. What may appear a stone to the ordinary man, 
continues Jalaluddin, further developing his theme, is a pearl 
to the Knower. 

Now the elusiveness of spiritual experience is glimpsed 
by the Seeker. If he is a creative worker, he enters the stage 
when inspiration enters him sometimes, but not at other 
times. If he is subject to ecstatic experience, he will find 
that the joyous meaningful sense of completeness comes 
transitorily, and that he cannot control it. The secret pro¬ 
tects itself: “Concentrate upon spirituality as you will—it 



THE SUFIS 


142 

will shun you if you are unworthy. Write about it, boast of 
it, comment upon it—it will decline to benefit you; it will 
flee. But, if it sees your concentration, it may come to your 
hand, like a trained bird. like the peacock, it will not sit 
in an unworthy place.” 

It is only when he is beyond this stage of development 
that the Sufi can communicate anything of the path to 
others. If he tries to do so before, "it will flee.” 

Here, too, the need for a delicate balance between ex¬ 
tremes is essential, or the whole effort may be in vain. The 
net which is your mind, observes Rumi, is delicate. It has 
to be so adjusted as to catch its catch. If there is unhappi¬ 
ness, the net is tom. If it is tom, it will not be of use. By 
too great love and too great opposition alike, the net be¬ 
comes tom. "Practice neither.” 

The five inner senses begin to function as the inner life 
of the individual is awakened. The food which is not a 
palpable food, spoken of by Rumi, starts to exercise a nu¬ 
tritious effect The inner senses resemble in a way the phys¬ 
ical ones, but "they are to them as copper to gold.” 

As individuals all vary in their capacities, the Sufis at this 
stage are developed in some ways and not in others. It is 
usual for a number of inner faculties and special abilities 
to develop concurrently and harmoniously. Changes in 
mood may occur, but they are not at all like the changes in 
mood which undeveloped people feel. Mood becomes a part 
of real personality, and the crudeness of ordinary moods is 
replaced by the alternation and interaction of higher moods, 
of which the lower ones are considered to be reflections. 

The Sufi's conception of wisdom and ignorance undergoes 
a change. Rumi puts it like this: "If a man were entirely 
wise, and had no ignorance, he would be destroyed by it. 
Therefore ignorance is laudable, because it means con¬ 
tinued existence. Ignorance is the collaborator of wisdom, 
in this sense of alternation, as night and day complement 
one another.”

reality, even though ordinary life seems to be the totality of 
reality itself. What we see, feel and experience in ordinary, 
unfulfilled life, according to Sufic thinking, is only a part 
of the great whole. There are dimensions which we can 
reach only through effort Like the submerged portion of 
the iceberg, they are there, though unperceived under ordi¬ 
nary conditions. Also like the iceberg, they are far greater 
than could be suspected by superficial study. 

Rumi uses several analogies to explain this. One of the 
most striking is his theory of action. There is, he says, such 
a thing as comprehensive action, and there is also individual 
action. We are accustomed to seeing, in the ordinary world 
of sense, only individual action. Supposing a number of 
people are making a tent. Some sew, others prepare the 
ropes, some again weave. They are all taking part in a 
comprehensive action, although each is absorbed in his in¬ 
dividual action. If we are thinking about the making of 
the tent, it is the comprehensive action of the whole group 
which is important 

In certain directions, the Sufi says, life must be looked 
upon as a whole, as well as individually. This getting into 
tune with the whole plan, the comprehensive action of life, 
is essential to enlightenment 

Little by little, as his experiences increase, the Sufi begins 
to reshape his thinking along these lines. Before he had 
actual experience of mysticism, he was either a scoffer, un¬ 
committed, or had a completely illusory idea of the nature 
of the experience, and especially of the teacher and the 
path. Rumi gives him meditations designed to overcome the 
overdevelopment of certain ideas which are current among

the uninstructed. Man expects to be given a golden key. 
But some are faster than others in developing. A man travel¬ 
ing through the darkness is yet traveling. The disciple is 
learning when he does not know that he is learning, and 
as a result he may well chafe. In winter, Rumi reminds 
him, a tree is collecting nutriment. People may think that 
it is idle, because they do not see anything happening. But 
in spring they see the buds. Now, they think, it is working. 
There is a time for collecting, and a time for releasing. 
This brings the subject back to the teaching: "Enlighten¬ 
ment must come little by little—otherwise it would over¬ 
whelm." 

The tools of scholasticism, used sparingly by Sufis, are 
being replaced by esoteric training, and this has to be done 
in accordance with the capacities of the student. The tools 
of the goldsmith, our teacher remarks, in the hands of the 
cobbler are like seeds sown in sand. And the cobbler’s tools 
in the farmer’s hand are like straw offered to a dog, or bones 
to a donkey. 

The attitude toward ordinary conventions of life under¬ 
goes an examination. The question of humanity’s inner 
yearnings is seen, not as a Freudian need, but as a natural 
instrument inherent in the mind in order to enable it to 
attain to truth. People, Rumi teaches, do not really know 
what they want. Their inner yearning is expressed in a 
hundred desires which they think are their needs. These 
are not their real desires, as experience shows. For when 
these objectives are attained, the yearning is not stilled. 
Rumi would have seen Freud as someone who was obsessed 
by one of the secondary manifestations of the great yearn¬ 
ing; not as someone who had discovered the basis of the 
yearning. 

Again, people may appear evil in one’s eyes—and yet to 
another individual they may seem fair. This is because in 
the one mind there is the idea of unpleasantness, in the 
other, the concept of goodness. ‘The fish and the hook are 
both present together."

will shun you if you are unworthy. Write about it, boast of 
it, comment upon it—it will decline to benefit you; it will 
flee. But, if it sees your concentration, it may come to your 
hand, like a trained bird. Like the peacock, it will not sit 
in an unworthy place." 

It is only when he is beyond this stage of development 
that the Sufi can communicate anything of the path to 
others. If he tries to do so before, "it will flee." 

Here, too, the need for a delicate balance between ex¬ 
tremes is essential, or the whole effort may be in vain. The 
net which is your mind, observes Rumi, is delicate. It has 
to be so adjusted as to catch its catch. If there is unhappi¬ 
ness, the net is tom. If it is tom, it will not be of use. By 
too great love and too great opposition alike, the net be¬ 
comes tom. "Practice neither." 

The five inner senses begin to function as the inner life 
of the individual is awakened. The food which is not a 
palpable food, spoken of by Rumi, starts to exercise a nu¬ 
tritious effect. The inner senses resemble in a way the phys¬ 
ical ones, but "they are to them as copper to gold.” 

As individuals all vary in their capacities, the Sufis at this 
stage are developed in some ways and not in others. It is 
usual for a number of inner faculties and special abilities 
to develop concurrently and harmoniously. Changes in 
mood may occur, but they are not at all like the changes in 
mood which undeveloped people feel. Mood becomes a part 
of real personality, and the crudeness of ordinary moods is 
replaced by the alternation and interaction of higher moods, 
of which the lower ones are considered to be reflections. 

The Sufi's conception of wisdom and ignorance undergoes 
a change. Rumi puts it like this: "If a man were entirely 
wise, and had no ignorance, he would be destroyed by it. 
Therefore ignorance is laudable, because it means con¬ 
tinued existence. Ignorance is the collaborator of wisdom, 
in this sense of alternation, as night and day complement 
one another." 

The working together of opposite things is another sig- 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI I 4 I 

The Sufi is learning the power of detachment, to be fol¬ 
lowed by the power of experiencing what he is consider¬ 
ing, not just looking at it. In order to do this, he is instructed 
by the teacher to meditate upon Rumi’s theme: “The 
satiated man and the hungry one do not see the same thing 
when they look upon a loaf of bread.” 

If a person is so untrained that he is influenced by his 
own bias, he cannot hope to make much progress. Rumi 
concentrates upon developing control; control through ex¬ 
perience, not through mere theory as to what is good or 
bad, right or wrong. This belongs to the category of words: 
“Words, in themselves, are of no importance. You treat a 
visitor well, and speak a few kind words to him. He is 
happy. But if you treat another man to a few words of 
abuse, he will be hurt. Can a few words really mean hap¬ 
piness or sadness? These are secondary factors, and not 
real ones. They affect people who are weak.” 

The Sufi learner is developing through his exercises a 
new way of seeing things. He is also acting, reacting, dif¬ 
ferently in a given situation than he otherwise would. He 
understands the deeper meaning of such recommendations 
as this: “Take the pearl, not the shell. You will not find a 
pearl in every shell. A mountain is many times larger than 
a ruby.” What seems almost trite to the ordinary man, per¬ 
haps passed on as a wise saw, becomes intensely meaning¬ 
ful to the Sufi, who finds in its depths contact with some¬ 
thing that he calls “other”—the underlying factor which he 
is seeking. What may appear a stone to the ordinary man, 
continues Jalaluddin, further developing his theme, is a pearl 
to the Knower. 

Now the elusiveness of spiritual experience is glimpsed 
by the Seeker. If he is a creative worker, he enters the stage 
when inspiration enters him sometimes, but not at other 
times. If he is subject to ecstatic experience, he will find 
that the joyous meaningful sense of completeness comes 
transitorily, and that he cannot control it. The secret pro¬ 
tects itself: “Concentrate upon spirituality as you will—it 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI I43 

nificant theme of Sufism. When apparent opposites are rec¬ 
onciled, the individuality is not only complete, it also 
transcends the hounds of ordinary humanity as we under¬ 
stand them. The individual becomes, as near as we can 
state it, immensely powerful. What this means, and how it 
takes place, are matters of personal experience outside the 
realm of mere writing. Rumi reminds us in another place, 
talking of the written words: “The book of the Sufis is not 
the darkness of letters. It is the whiteness of a pure heart." 

Now the Sufi attains some of the insights which are as¬ 
sociated with the developing of an infallible intuition. His 
feeling for knowledge is such that he can, by reading a 
book, often sift the fact from the fiction, the real intention 
of the author from other elements. Especially threatened 
by this faculty are the imitators, who claim to be Sufis, and 
whom he is able to see through. Yet his sense of balance 
shows him how far the imitator may be of value in the 
cause of Sufism. Rumi comments upon this function in the 
Mathnawi, and this teaching is faithfully passed on by 
Sufi teachers when they find that the student has reached 
this stage: “The imitator is like a canal. It does not itself 
drink, but may transit water to the thirsty." 

As he progresses on the path, the Sufi realizes how im¬ 
mensely complex and even perilous it is, unless carried out 
in accordance with the method which has been developed 
through the ages. Using a fable, the Mathnawi records this 
stage of the experiences. A lion entered a stable, ate an ox 
which he found there, and sat in its place. The stable was 
dark, and the ox's owner entered and felt around for his 
animal. His hands passed over the lion's body. The lion said, 
“If there were any light, he would die of fright. He strokes 
me thus only because he takes me for an ox." Read as an 
ordinary story, this vivid sketch might be passed over as 
just a version of fools rushing in where angels fear to 
tread. 

The understanding of true meanings behind inexplicable 
worldly happenings is another consequence of Sufi develop- 



THE SUEIS 


I44 

ment Why, for instance, does a certain phase in mystical 
study take one person longer than another, even if he is 
carrying out roughly the same routines? Rumi illustrates 
the experiencing of a special dimension in life which veils 
the complete workings of actuality, giving us an unsatisfac¬ 
tory view of the whole. Two beggars, he says, came to the 
door of a house. One was immediately satisfied, and given a 
piece of bread. He went away. The second was kept waiting 
for his morsel. Why? The first beggar was not greatly liked; 
he was given stale bread. The second was made to wait until 
a fresh loaf was baked for him. This story illustrates a theme 
which recurs frequently in Sufic teaching—that there is 
often one element in a happening which we do not know. 
Yet we base our opinions upon material which is incom¬ 
plete. Small wonder that the uninitiated develops and passes 
on a "squint” which is self-perpetuating. 

"You belong,” sings Rumi in one verse, "to the world of 
dimension. But you come from nondimension. Close the 
first 'shop/ open the second.” 

All life and all creation is seen in a new and compre¬ 
hensive form. The worker, to use the imagery of the Math- 
nawi, is ‘hidden in the workshop,” hidden by the work, 
which has, as it were, spun a web over him. The workshop 
is the place of vision. Outside it is the place of darkness. 

The Sufi's position as one with greater insight into mat¬ 
ters of the world and of the whole, as opposed to the part, 
gives him a tremendous potentiality for power. But he can 
exercise this only in association with the rest of creation 
—first with the other Sufis, then with mankind, finally with 
all creation. His powers and his very being are linked with 
a new set of relationships. People come to him, and he 
realizes that even those who scoff have quite possibly come 
to learn rather than to score a point over him. He regards a 
great number of happenings as a sort of question and an¬ 
swer. A visit to a sage he considers to be the approach, 
"Teach me.” Hunger may be a questing, a question: ®5Cnd 
food.” Abstinence from food is an answer, a negative one. 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI I45 

And, as Rumi concludes this passage, the answer to the 
existence of a fool is silence. 

He is able to pass on a part of his mystical experience to 
certain others, some of the disciples who come to him, and 
who are adapted by their past experiences for such a de¬ 
velopment. This is sometimes done by mutual concentration 
exercises ( tajalli ), and its practice may develop into the 
true mystical experience. “At first,” Rumi told his disciples, 
“enlightenment comes to you from the Adepts. This is 
imitation. But when it comes frequently, it is the experience 
of truth.” A Sufi may often, during many of the stages of 
the search, seem to be unheeding of the feelings of others, 
or otherwise out of step with society. When this is so, it is 
because he has glimpsed the true character of a situation 
behind the apparent situation visible only partially to 
others. He acts in the best possible way, though he does not 
always know why he has said or done a thing. 

Jalaluddin, in Fihi Ma Fihi, gives an illustration of just 
such a situation. A drunken man saw a King pass by with a 
highly prized horse. He called out some uncomplimentary 
remark about the horse. The King was angry, and sum¬ 
moned him to his presence later. “At that time,” explained 
the man, “a drunkard was standing on that roof. I am not 
him, for he is gone.” The King was pleased with the reply, 
and rewarded him. The drunk is the Sufi, just as is the 
sobered man. The Sufi, in his state of association with true 
reality, acted in a certain way. As a result he was rewarded. 
He had also performed a function in explaining to the King 
that people are not always responsible for their actions. He 
had, too, given the King a chance to perform a good action. 

No ripe grape becomes unripe again, and human evolu¬ 
tion cannot be stopped. It can be directed, however; and it 
can also be interfered with by those who do not know what 
true intuition is. Thus the teachings of the Sufis can become 
distorted; thus, too, can the Adept be treated if he allows 
himself to be seen too openly by the profane. As for actually 
preaching Sufic things to those without, Rumi, like other 



I46 THE SUEIS 

Sufi teachers, is prepared always to make a general invi¬ 
tation: 

While the inner lamp of jewels is still alight, 

hasten to trim its wick and provide it with oik 

But he is in accord with the teachers who refuse to discuss 
the cult with all and sundry: “Summon horses to a place 
other than where grass is to be found; and they will ques¬ 
tion it”—no matter what it is. 

The Sufis oppose the pure intellectuals and scholastic 
philosophers partly because they believe that such training 
of the mind in obsessive and one-track thinking is bad for 
that mind and for all other minds as well. Equally, those 
who think that all that matters is intuition or asceticism are 
strongly combated by Sufic teaching. Rumi insists upon the 
balance of all the faculties. 

The union of mind and intuition which brings about 
illumination and the development which the Sufis seek is 
based upon love, always love—this insistent theme of Rumi 
is nowhere better expressed than in his writings, unless it 
be within the actual walls of a Sufi school. Just as intel- 
lectualism works with palpable materials, Sufism works with 
both perceptible and inner ones. Where science and scho¬ 
lasticism ever narrow their scope to take in smaller and 
smaller areas of study, Sufism continues to embrace every 
evidence of the great underlying truth, wherever it may be 
found. 

This power of assimilation and ability to invoke symbol¬ 
ism, story and thought from the underground Sufic current 
has caused the outward commentators (even in the East) 
great excitement and new pastimes. They track down the 
origins of a story in India, an idea in Greece, an exercise 
among shamans. These elements they bear back delightedly 
to their desks, eventually to provide ammunition in the 
struggle in which their opponents are only each other. The 
unique atmosphere of Sufi schools is found in the Math - 



OUR MASTER JALALUDDIN RUMI 147 

nawi and Fihi Ma Fihi. But many externalists consider 
that they are confusing, chaotic and loosely written. 

True, both books are partially guides which have to be 
used in conjunction with actual Sufic teaching and prac¬ 
tice-work, thought, life and art. But even one commentator 
who accepted the reality of this atmosphere as deliberately 
created, and who repeated the Sufi account of this in print, 
showed himself in personal contact to be rather bewildered 
by the whole thing. Still, it must be said that he considered 
himself to be a Sufi, although not admitted by any Sufic 
method. Under the influence of such men, the Western 
study of Sufism, now in a period of tremendous upsurge, 
has become a little more Sufic, although it still has a very 
long way to go. The "intellectual Sufi” is the latest fad in 
the West. 

Sufism, of course, has a technical terminology all its own, 
and Rumi’s verses teem with familiar and special varieties 
of initiatory terms. He describes, for instance, in his third 
great book. The Diwan of Shams of Tabriz, some of the 
concepts of mind and activities which are projected within 
a secret meeting of dervishes. Couched in rhapsodic verse, 
the teachings of Sufi being "in thought and action” are 
conveyed by a method especially devised for their projec¬ 
tion: 

Join the community, be like them, so see the joy of real 
life. Go along the ruined street, and see the dis¬ 
traught (owners 0 f the "ruined houses”). Drink the 
cup of feeling, so that you do not feel shame (self- 
consciousness). Shut both the eyes of the head, so 
that you may see with the inner eye. Open the two 
arms of your self, if you seek an embrace. Shatter the 
earthen idol in order to see the face of idols. Why ac¬ 
cept so great a dowry for a feeble hag—and for three 
loaves why do you accept military servitude? 

The Friend returns at night; tonight do not take a 
draught—shut your mouth against food, that you gain 



THE SUFIS

. the food of the mouth. In the assembly of the kindly 
Cupbearer, circle yourself—come into the Circle. How 
long will you circle (around it)? Here is an offer- 
leave one life, gain the Shepherd's kindliness. . . • 
Cease thought except for the creator of thought- 
thought for 'life" is better than thought of bread. In 
the amplitude of God's earth, why have you fallen 
asleep in a prison? Abandon complicated thoughts—in 
order to see the concealed answer. Be silent of speech, 
to attain enduring speech. Pass “life" and “world," in 
order to see the life of the World. 

Although the actuality of Sufi being cannot be assayed 
by the more limited criteria of discursive thought, this poem 
can be seen as an assembling of the salient factors in the 
Rumi method. He stipulates a community, dedicated to per¬ 
ceiving reality, of which apparent reality is only a substi¬ 
tute. This cognition comes through contact with others, by 
being engaged in group activity, as well as in personal 
activity and thought. What actually is fundamental comes 
only when certain patterns of thinking have been reduced 
to their correct perspective. The Seeker must “open his 
arms" to an embrace, not expect to be given anything while 
he stands passively awaiting it. The “feeble hag" is the whole 
array of mundane experiences, which are reflections of an 
ultimate reality that bears hardly any comparison with what 
seems to be truth. For the “three loaves" of ordinary life, 
people sell their potentiality. 

The Friend comes at night—comes, that is, when things 
are still, and when the individual is not drugged by auto¬ 
matic thinking. The food which is a special nutrition of 
the Sufi is not the same as the ordinary food; but it is an es¬ 
sential part of the human intake. Humanity is circling 
around reality, in a system which is not the real system. It 
must enter the circle instead of following its perimeter. The 
relationship of the real awareness to what we consider to be 
awareness is as of a hundred lives to one life. Certain

characteristics of life as we know it—the predatory and self¬ 
ish ones, the many others which are barriers to progress- 
must be outbalanced by benign factors. 

Thought, not pattern-thinking, is the method. Thought 
must be for all life, not for small aspects of it Man is like 
someone who has the choice of traversing the earth, but 
has fallen asleep in a prison. The complications of mis¬ 
placed intellectualism hide the truth. Silence is a prelude 
to speech, real speech. The inner life of the world is gained 
by ignoring the fragmentation implied by ‘life” and “world.” 

When Rumi died in 1273 he left his son Bahaudin to 
carry on the generalship of the Mevlevi Order. Surrounded 
in life by people of every creed, his funeral was attended by 
people of every description. 

A Christian was asked why he wept so bitterly at the 
death of a Moslem teacher. His reply shows the Sufi idea of 
recurrence of teaching and of the transmission of spiritual 
activity: 

‘We esteem him as the Moses, the David, the Jesus of 
the age. We are all his followers and his disciples.” 

The life of Rumi shows the mixture of transmitted lore 
and personal illumination which is central to Sufism. His 
family was descended from Abu Bakr, the Companion of 
Mohammed, and his father was related to King Khwarizm 
Shah. Jalaluddin was born in Balkh, a center of ancient 
teaching, in the year 1207, and it is claimed in Sufi legend 
that it was foretold by Sufi mystics that a great future would 
be his. The King of Balkh, under the influence of powerful 
scholastics, turned against the Sufis, and especially against 
his kinsman, our RumiV father. One Sufi master was 
drowned in the Oxus by order of the Shah. This persecu¬ 
tion foreshadowed the invasion of the Mongols, in which 
Najmuddin (the Greatest), the Sufi leader, was killed on 
rile battlefield. It is this master who founded the Kubravi 
Order, which is closely connected with the development of 
Rumi.

father fled with his young son to Nishapur, where they met 
another great teacher of the same Sufi stream, the poet At¬ 
tar, who blessed the child and “spiritualized” him with the 
Sufi baraka . He presented to the boy a copy of his Asrctr- 
nama (Book of Secrets), written in verse. 

Sufi tradition has it that since the spiritual potential of 
the young Jalaluddin had been recognized by the contem¬ 
porary masters, their concern for his protection and develop¬ 
ment became the motive for the travels of the refugee party. 
They left Nishapur with the saintly Attar’s words in their 
ears: “This boy will spark the fire of divine exaltation for 
the world.” The city was not safe. Attar, like Najmuddin, 
awaited his turn for a martyr’s grave, which he gained at 
the hands of the Mongols not long afterward. 

The Sufi group with their fledgling leader reached Bagh¬ 
dad, where they heard of the utter destruction of Balkh and 
the slaughter of its inhabitants. For some years they wan¬ 
dered, performing the pilgrimage to Mecca, returning 
northward to Syria and Asia Minor, visiting Sufi centers. 

Central Asia was falling apart under the relentless blows 
of the Mongols, and Islamic civilization, after less than six

Rumi’s father ultimately made his headquarters not far 
from Konia, which is associated with the name of St. Paul. 
The city was at this time in the hands of the Seljuk mon-

accepted a professorial post, and continued instructing his 
son in the Sufi mysteries. 

Jalaluddin also came into contact with the Greatest 
Master, the poet and teacher Ibn El-Arabi of Spain, who 
was in Baghdad about this time. The contact was established 
through Burhanudin, one of Rumi’s teachers, who had made 
his way to the Seljuk regions to find Rumi’s father recently 
dead. Replacing him as Rumi’s mentor, he took him to

semipublic mystical teachings. 2 The mysterious dervish 
“Sun of the Faith of Tabriz” inspired him to produce a great 
deal of his finest poetry, and to couch his teachings in a 
manner and form they were to retain throughout the life 
of the Mevlevi Order. His work done, the dervish vanished 
after about three years, and no further trace of him was ever 
reported. 

This “emissary from the unknown world” has been 
equated by Rumi’s son with the mysterious Khidr, the guide 
and patron of the Sufis, who appears and then passes out of 
normal cognition after transmitting his message. 

It was during this time that Rumi became a poet. For him, 
although acknowledged^ one of the greatest poets of Persia, 
poetry was only a secondary product. He did not regard it 
as any more than a reflection of the enormous inner reality 
which was truth, and which he calls love. The greatest love, 
as he says, is silent and cannot be expressed in words. Al¬ 
though his poetry was to affect men’s minds in a way that 
can only be called magical, he was never carried away by it 
to the extent of identifying it with the far greater being of 
which it was a lesser expression. At the same time, he rec¬ 
ognized it as something which could form a bridge between 
what he “really felt” and what he could do for others. 

Adopting the Sufic methods of getting a thing into per¬ 
spective, even at the risk of demolishing the fondest ideas, 
he himself assumes the role of critic of poetry. People come 
to him, he says, and he loves them. In order to give them 
something to understand, he gives them poetry. But poetry 
is for them, not for him, however great a poet he may be— 
“What, after all, is my concern with poetry?” In order to 
hammer home the message, as only a poet with the greatest 
contemporary reputation could dare to do, he states cate¬ 
gorically that in comparison with the true reality, he has no

time for poetry. This is the only nutrition, he says, that his 
visitors can accept, “so like a good host he provides it." 

The Sufi must never allow anything to stand as a barrier 
between what he is teaching and those who are learning it 
Hence Rumi’s insistence upon the subsidiary role of poetry 
in the perspective of the real quest What he had to com¬ 
municate was beyond poetry. To a mind conditioned to the 
belief that there is nothing more sublime than poetic ex¬ 
pression, such a feeling might produce a sense of shock. It 
is just this application of impact which is necessary to the 
Sufi cause, in the freeing of the mind from attachment to 
secondary phenomena, “idols.” 

Rumi, the inheritor of his father's chair, now projected 
his mystical teachings through artistic channels. Music, 
danrmg and poetry were cultivated and used in the dervish 
m pptingc Alternating with these were certain mental and 
physical exercises designed to open the mind to the recogni¬ 
tion of its greater potential, through the theme of harmony. 
Harmonious development, through the medium of harmony, 
might be a description of what Rumi was practicing. 

Studying such of his teachings as they can from the out¬ 
side, many foreign observers have been bewildered by Rumi. 
One refers to his “very unoriental view that woman is not a 
mere plaything, but a ray of deity ” 

One poem of Rumi’s, published in The Dtwan of Shams 
of Tabriz, has caused a certain amount of confusion to the 
literalists. It appears to refer to Rumi’s examination of all 
farms of current religion, old and new, and his conclusion 
that the essential truth lay in the inner consciousness of 
man himself, not in external organizations. This is true if 
we realize that, according to Sufi belief, the “examining” of 
these creeds is done in a special way. The Sufi does not 
necessarily literally travel from one country to another, seek¬ 
ing religions to study and taking what he can from them. 
Neither does he read books of theology and exegesis, in 
order to compare one with the other. His “journey” and his

“examination” of other ideas takes place within himself. 
This is because the Sufi believes that, like anyone experi¬ 
enced in anything else, he has an inner sense against which 
he can measure the reality of religious systems. To be more 
specific, it would appear nonsensically cumbersome to ap¬ 
proach a metaphysical subject by ordinary research methods. 
Anyone who said to him, “Have you read the book on such 
and such by so-and-so?” would be using the wrong ap¬ 
proach. It is not the book, nor the author, but the reality of 
what that book and that man signify, which are important 
to the Sufi. In order to make his assessment of a person or 
his teachings, the Sufi needs only a sample. But this sample 
has to be accurate. He must, in other words, be placed into 
rapport with the essential factor in the teaching in ques¬ 
tion. A disciple, for instance, who does not thoroughly 
understand the system which he is following cannot convey 
enough of that system to the Sufi to enable an assessment 
to be made. 

This is the poem in which Rumi speaks of the attaining 
of the rapport with the various faiths, and his reaction to 
them: 

Cross and Christians, end to end, I examined. He was 
not on the Cross. I went to the Hindu temple, to the 
ancient pagoda. In neither was there any sign. To the 
heights of Herat I went, and Kandahar. I looked. He 
was not on height or lowland. Resolutely, I went to 
the top of the Mountain of Kaf. There only was the 
place of the ’Anqa bird. I went to the Kaaba. He was 
not there. I asked of his state from Ibn Sina: he was 
beyond the limits of the philosopher Avicenna. ... I 
looked into my own heart. In that his place I saw him. 
He was in no other place. . . . 

This “he” (which, i n the original, could be either he, she 
or it) is the true reality. The Sufi is eternal, and his use of 
words like “drunkenness” or “grape” or “heart” is necessary 



THE SUFIS 


154 

but ultimately so approximate as to appear a travesty. As 
Rumi puts it: 

Before garden, vine or grape were in the world 

Our soul was drunken with immortal wine. 

The Sufi may be compelled to use similes drawn from 
the familiar world at an early stage of transmission, but 
Rumi follows the standard Sufi formula very strictly. The 
crutches must be removed if the patient is to be able to walk 
by himself. The value of Rumi s mode of expression for the 
student is the fact that he makes this much more plain than 
most material available outside of Sufi schools. If certain 
external Orders have fallen into the habit of literally con¬ 
ditioning their followers to repetitious stimuli, marking time 
at a certain stage of development, retaining the attachment 
of the disciples to the "crutches," it is no fault of Jalaluddin 
Rumi.

the contemporary scene, connecting it with the existing

legitimate and in accordance with Sufi thinking. As the 
Sufic term for scatter (NSHR) was not at the time used 
publicly, Ibn El-Arabi employed an alternative word for it. 
He was known in Spain as Ibn Saraqa, “Son of a small 
saw.” Saraqa, however, from the root SRQ, stands for an¬ 
other word for saw, derived from the NSHR root. The 
NSHR root when normally inflected means “publication, 
spreading,” as well as “sawing.” It also means revivification. 
Muhiyuddin, Ibn El-Arabis personal name, translates as 
“reviver of faith.” 3 

Taking the NSHR root literally, as most scholars were 
bound to do, has caused even such a respectable historian 
as Ibn el-Abbar to conclude that his father was a carpenter. 
He could only have been a “carpenter” in the secondary 
sense known to Sufis who adopted guild terms for their

place of a number of people who did not want to appear to 
be a subversive group. 

Taken on their own, some of the statements of Ibn El- 
Arabi are startling. In Bezels of Wisdom , he says that God 
is never to be seen in an immaterial form. “The sight of 
God in woman is the most perfect of all.” Love poetry, as 
with everything else to the Sufi, is capable of reflecting a 
complete and coherent experience of divinity, while con¬ 
currently fulfilling various other functions. Every Sufi ex¬ 
perience is an experience in depth and in qualitative in¬ 
finity. It is only to the ordinary man or woman that a word 
has only one meaning, or an experience less than a large 
number of equally valid, whole significances. This multi¬ 
plicity of being is something which, although accepted as a 
contention by non-Sufis, is frequently forgotten by them 
when they deal with Sufi material. At best they can gener¬ 
ally appreciate that there is an allegory-which means to 
them just one alternative meaning.

Ibn El-Arabi: The Greatest Sheikh 


To the sinful and vidous, I 
may appear to be evil. But to 
the good—beneficent am I. 

(Mirza Khan, Ansari) 


One of the most profound metaphysical influences upon 
both the Moslem and Christian worlds is Ibn El-Arabi the 
Sufi, called in Arabic "the Greatest Master." He was a 
descendant of Hatim El-Tai, still famous among the Arabs 
as the most generous man who ever lived and mentioned 
in FitzGerald's Rubaiyat—“Let Hatim Tai cry ‘Supper!': 
Heed him not!" 

Spain had been an Arab country for more than four hun¬ 
dred years when Ibn El-Arabi the Murdan was bom in 
1164. Among his names is "the Andalusian," and he was 
undoubtedly one of the greatest Spaniards who ever lived. 
It is commonly believed that there is no greater love poetry 
than his; nor was there ever a Sufi who so profoundly im¬ 
pressed the orthodox theologians with the interior meaning 
of his life and work. 

His Sufi background, according to biographers, was that 
his father was in contact with the great Abdul-Qadir 
Jilani, 1 Sultan of the Friends (1077-1166). Ibn El-Arabi 

1 See annotation “Jilani.” 



THE SUFIS 


156 

himself is said to have been born as a result of the spiritual 
influence of Abdul-Qadir, who predicted that he would be 
a person of outstanding gifts. 

His father was determined to give him the best possible 
education, something which was offered in Moorish Spain 
at the time to a degree almost unparalleled elsewhere. He 
went to Lisbon, where he studied law and Islamic theology. 
Next, while still a boy, he went on to Seville, where he 
learned the Koran and the traditions under the greatest 
scholars of the time. At C6rdoba he attended the classes of 
the great Sheikh El-Sharrat, and distinguished himself in 
jurisprudence. 

During this period, Ibn El-Arabi showed qualities of in¬ 
tellect far beyond those which distinguished his contem¬ 
poraries, even though they were drawn from the scholastic 
elite in whose families such intellectual capacity was pro¬ 
verbial in the middle ages. During his adolescence, in spite 
of the severe discipline of the academic schools, he spent 
his free time almost entirely with the Sufis, and began to 
write poetry. 

He lived in Seville for three decades, his poetry and elo¬ 
quence winning for him a place second to none in the 
highly cultivated atmosphere of Spain, as well as in Mo¬ 
rocco, which was itself a center of cultural life. 

In some ways Ibn El-Arabi resembled El-Ghazali (1058- 
iiii). like him, he came from a Sufi family, and was to 
influence Western thought Again like him, he was pre¬ 
eminent in Islamic lore. But whereas Ghazali first mastered 
Islamic scholasticism, found it insufficient, and then turned 
to Sufism at the height of his greatness, Ibn El-Arabi main¬ 
tained, through associations and poetry, a continuous con¬ 
tact with the Sufic stream. Ghazali reconciled Sufism with 
Islam, making the scholastics understand that it was not a 
heresy, but an inner meaning of religion. Ibn El-Arabi's 
mission was to create Sufi literature and cause it to be 
studied in order that people might thus enter into the spirit 



IBN EL-ARABi: THE GREATEST SHEIKH 157 

of Sufism—discover the Sufis through their being and ex¬ 
pression, whatever their cultural background might be. 

How this process worked is exemplified in a comment 
by the distinguished Professor R. A. Nicholson, who trans¬ 
lated El-Arabi's Interpreter of Desires: 

Some of the poems, it is true, are not distinguishable 
from ordinary love songs, and as regards a great portion 
of the text, the attitude of the author's contemporaries, 
who refused to believe that it had any esoteric sense at 
all, was natural and intelligible; on the other hand 
there are many passages which are obviously mystical 
and give a clue to the rest. If the sceptics lacked dis¬ 
cernment, they deserve our gratitude for having pro¬ 
voked Ibn El-Arabi to instruct them. Assuredly, with¬ 
out his guidance the most sympathetic readers would 
seldom have hit upon the hidden meanings which his 
fantastic ingenuity elicits from an Arabic qasida . 2 

A very great deal of Ibn El-Arabi's writings remain in a 
like case up to this day, as far as others than Sufis are con¬ 
cerned. Some of his material is addressed to those who have 
a grasp of ancient mythology, and is couched in those terms. 
Some, which connects with Christianity, serves as a lead-in 
to people with a Christian commitment. Other poetry serves 
to introduce the Sufi Way by means of love poetry. No 
single individual can unravel all his work only by means 
of scholastic, religious, romantic or intellectual equipment 
This brings us to another hint of his mission, which is con¬ 
tained in his name. 

According to Sufi tradition, Ibn El-Arabi's mission was 
to "scatter" (Arabic nashr , NSHR) Sufi lore throughout 

2 The Tarjuman Al-Ashwaq (Interpreter of Desires), tr. R. A. 
Nicholson, London, 19 n, p. 7. Professor Nicholson’s opinions about 
Sufism must he treated with great reserve. An example is this aston¬ 
ishing remark, almost incomprehensible to a Sufi: "Professing to adore 
a universal abstraction, they make individual men the objects of their 
real worship." (Selections from the Diwan-i-S hams-i-Tahriz, tr. Nich¬ 
olson, Cambridge, 1898, p. xxi.)

IBN EL-ARABI.* THE GREATEST SHEIKH 159 

To the theologians, committed to a literal acceptance of 
divine formalism, Ibn El-Arabi bluntly says that "Angels 
are the powers hidden in the faculties and organs of man." 
It is the Sufi's objective to activate these organs. 

Unmindful of the difference between formulation and 
experience, Dante 4 took over Ibn El-Arabi's literary work 
and crystallized it within a currently possible framework 
In so doing, he robbed Ibn El-Arabi's message of its Sufic 
validity, and merely left Professor Asin with an embalmed 
example of what to the modem mind almost amounts to 
piracy. Raymond Lully, on the contrary, took over literary 
material from Ibn El-Arabi, but in addition emphasized the 
importance of the Sufi exercises which are necessary to com¬ 
plete the Sufic experiences. 

Ibn El-Arabi, who studied under the Spanish woman 
Sufi Fatima b. Waliyya, was undoubtedly subject to special 
psychic states, such as are cultivated by the Sufis. He refers 
to these on various occasions. Some of his work was written 
in trance, and its meaning did not become clear to him until 
some time after its writing down. When he was thirty-seven, 
he visited Ceuta, where the renowned Ibn Sabain (who ad¬ 
vised the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick) had his school. 
There he had a strange vision or dream, which was inter¬ 
preted by a famous scholar. The sage said: "Immeasur¬ 
able. ... If this individual is in Ceuta, it can be none 
other than the recently arrived young Spaniard." 

The source of his inspiration was reverie in which the 
consciousness was still active. By the exercise of this Sufi 
faculty, he was able to produce from the innermost mind a 
contact with supreme reality—the reality which he explained 
underlay the appearances of the familiar world. 

His teaching stressed the importance of this exercise of 
faculties which are unknown to most people, and consigned 
to credulous occultism by the many. "A person," he said, 
"must control his thoughts in a dream. The training of this

alertness will produce awareness of the intermediate dimen¬ 
sion. It will produce great benefits for the individual. 
Everyone should apply himself to the attainment of this 
ability of such great value ." 5 

It is quite hopeless to attempt an interpretation of Ibn 
El-Arabi from a fixed position. His teachings are derived 
from the inner experiences, then presented within a form 
which itself has a function. Where his poetry has a double 
meaning, and it often has, he intends not only to convey 
both meanings but to affirm that both are valid. Where it is 
expressed in terms used by others before him, it is not in¬ 
tended by him that this should be taken as evidence of out¬ 
side influence. What he is doing here is to address himself 
to people in terminology which forms a part of their own 
cultural background. There are poems of Ibn El-Arabi’s 
which can be read in a shifting sense—the meaning starting 
in one theme and drifting into another. He has done this 
deliberately, in order to prevent the automatic associative 
processes from carrying the reader away into ordinary en¬ 
joyment; because El-Arabi is a teacher, not an entertainer. 

For Ibn El-Arabi, as for all Sufis, Mohammed represents 
the Perfected Man. At the same time, it is necessary to know 
what is meant by "Mohammed" in this context Ibn El- 
Arabi is more explicit than most on this point There are 
two versions of Mohammed—the man who lived in Mecca 
and Medina, and the eternal Mohammed. It is this latter 
one of whom he speaks. This Mohammed is identified with 
all die prophets, including Jesus. This idea has caused peo¬ 
ple with a Christian background to claim that Ibn El-Arabi 
or the Sufis or both were secret Christians. The Sufi claim 
is that all the individuals who have performed certain 
functions are in a sense one. This oneness they call in its 
origin haqiqatrel-Mohammedia , the Reality of Mohammed. 

Jili, in his standard Sufi text, The Perfect Man , explains 
the incarnation of this Reality among all peoples. He seeks 

5 Quoted by Ibn Shadakin. 



IBN EL-ABABi: THE GREATEST SHEIKH l6l 

to describe the essential factor, by showing the multiplicity 
of what we call an individual. Mohammed, for instance, 
means The Praised One. Another name, which is only a 
description of a function, is Father of El-Qasim. In his name 
of Abdullah, he stands for its literal meaning—Servant of 
God. Names are qualities or functions. Incarnation is a 
secondary factor: “He is given names and in every age has 
a name which is appropriate to the guise in which he ap¬ 
pears in that age. . . . When he is seen as Mohammed, he 
is Mohammed, but when he is seen in another form, he is 
called by the name of that form.” 

This is not a reincarnation theory, however much it may 
resemble one. The essential reality which activates the man 
called Mohammed or anything else has to be given a name 
in conformity with the environment. Those who have 
identified this attitude with the Logos doctrine of Plotinus 
are, according to the Sufis, ascribing a historical connec¬ 
tion to a situation which has objective reality. The Sufis 
did not copy the Logos doctrine, though the idea of the 
Logos and of the Reality of Mohammed have a common 
source. Ultimately the source of Sufi information on this, 
as on other points, is the personal experience of the Sufi, 
not the literary formulation which has been one of its 
historical manifestations. The trap of historical thinking, 
which assumes no basic interior source for knowledge and 
has to seek literary and superficial inspiration, is constantly 
avoided by the Sufi. Several Western students of Sufism 
have, it must be admitted, emphasized that similarity of ap¬ 
pearances, of terminology or of date do not prove transmis¬ 
sion of the essential idea. 

Ibn El-Arabi confused the scholars because he was what 
is called in Islam a conformist in religion while remaining 
an esoteridst in inner life. Like all Sufis he claimed that 
there was a coherent, continuous and perfectly acceptable 
progression between formal religion of any kind and the 
inner understanding of that religion, leading to a personal 
enlightenment. This doctrine, naturally, could not be ac- 


THE SUFIS 


162 

cepted by theologians, whose importance depended upon 
more or less static facts, historical material and the use of 
reasoning powers. 

Although Ibn El-Arabi is loved by all Sufis, had an im¬ 
mense personal following among people of all kinds, and 
lived an exemplary life, he was undoubtedly a threat to 
formal society. Like Ghazali, his intellectual powers were 
superior to those of almost all his more conventional con¬ 
temporaries. Instead of making use of these abilities to carve 
a place in scholasticism, he claimed, like many another Sufi, 
that when one has a powerful intellect, its ultimate func¬ 
tion is to show that intellectuality is merely a prelude to 
something else. Such an attitude seems impossible arro¬ 
gance—unless one has actually met such a person and 
known his humility. 

Many people sympathized with him, but did not dare 
to support him, because they were working on a formal 
plane, and he on an initiatory one. One respected divine 
is on record as saying: “I have no doubt at all that 
Muhiyuddin (Ibn El-Arabi) is a deliberate liar. He is a 
chief among heretics and a hardened Sufi.” The great theo¬ 
logian, Kamaludin Zamlaqani, however, exclaimed: “How 
ignorant are those who oppose the Sheikh Muhiyuddin Ibn 
El-Arabi! His sublime sayings and the precious words in 
his writings are too advanced for their understanding.” 

On a famous occasion, the renowned teacher Sheikh 
Izedin ibn Abdesalam was presiding over a group of stu¬ 
dents of the religious law. During a discussion the question 
of defining hypocritical heretics arose. Someone cited Ibn 
El-Arabi as a prime example. The teacher did not challenge 
the assertion. Later, when dining with the teacher, Salahud- 
din, who later became the Shiekh of Islam, asked him who 
was the most eminent sage of the age: 

“He said, What is that to you? Eat on/ I realized that 
he knew, stopped eating and pressed him in God's name to 
tell me who it was. He smiled, then said, “The Sheikh 
Muhiyuddin Ibn El-Arabi/ For a moment I was so amazed 



IBN EL-AHABi: THE GREATEST SHEIKH 163 

that I could say nothing. The Sheikh asked me what was 
the matter. I said, ‘I am in wonderment because this very 
morning a man has stated that he is a heretic. On that oc¬ 
casion you did not contest it. Now you call Muhiyuddin the 
Magnetic Pole of the Age, the greatest man alive, the 
teacher of the world/ 

“He said, ‘But it was in a meeting of scholars, legists/ ” 

The main opposition to Ibn El-Arabi was due to his truly 
amazing collection of odes—love poetry known as the In¬ 
terpreter of Desires . The poetry is so sublime, has so many 
possible meanings, is so full of fantastic imagery that it can 
exercise a magical effect upon the reader. For the Sufis it is 
regarded as the product of the most advanced development 
of human consciousness possible to man. It is only fair to 
add here that D. B. MacDonald considers Ibn El-Arabi's 
outpourings as “a strange jumble of theosophy and meta¬ 
physical paradoxes, all much like the theosophy of our day." 

For scholars one of the important things about the In¬ 
terpreter is that there is extant a commentary on the poems, 
made by the author himself, in which he explains how the 
imagery fits in with orthodox Islamic religion. How this 
came about can only be studied against the background of 
the book's history. 

In the year 1202 El-Arabi decided to go on the pilgrimage. 
After spending some time in traveling through North 
Africa, he arrived in Mecca and there met a group of 
Persian immigrants, mystics who welcomed him into their 
fold, in spite of the fact that he had been accused of heresy 
and worse in Egypt, He narrowly escaped an attempt by a 
fanatic to murder him. 

The chief of this Persian community was named 
Mukinuddin. He had a beautiful daughter, Nizam, devout 
and well versed in the religious law. His spiritual ex¬ 
periences in Mecca, and his symbolical rendering of the 
path of the mystic, are expressed in love poems dedicated 
to her. El-Arabi realized that human beauty was con¬ 
nected with divine reality; and for this reason he was able 


THE SUFIS 


164 

to produce poems which both celebrated the perfection of 
the maiden and also, in correct perspective, stood for a 
deeper reality. But the capacity to see the connection was 
denied to the formal religionists, who professed themselves 
scandalized. The poet’s supporters have pointed out, often 
in vain, that real truth may be expressed in several different 
ways simultaneously. They refer to Ibn El-Arabi’s use of 
myths and legends, as well as traditional history, to express 
the esoteric truths which are concealed within them, as well 
as the entertainment value which they have. Such a con¬ 
cept of the multiplicity of the meaning of one and the same 
factor was as little understood during his time as it is today. 
The nearest that the ordinary individual can get to this is 
to allow that "a beautiful woman is a divine work of art" 
He is not able to perceive the beautiful woman and the 
divinity at the same time. This is the entire problem of Sufi 
statement in a nutshell. 

Ibn El-Arabi’s Interpreter therefore reads, on the surface, 
as a collection of erotic poems. When he traveled to Aleppo 
in Syria, a stronghold of religious orthodoxy, he found that 
the divines of Islam were saying that he was a mere pre¬ 
tender, trying to justify his erotic poesy by claiming a 
deeper meaning. He immediately set to work on a com¬ 
mentary to bring the work into orthodox focus. The result 
was that the scholars were entirely satisfied, because the 
author had helped to support their own interpretations of 
the religious law by his explanations of the meaning of his 
work. For the Sufi, however, there was a third meaning to 
the Interpreter . Ibn El-Arabi, by using familiar terminology, 
was showing them that superficialities might be true, that 
human love might be completely valid; but that both of these 
things in actuality veiled an inner truth, or were an ex¬ 
tension of it 

It is this inner reality which he refers to when he accepts 
all f ormalism , yet claims a truth behind and beyond it. Pro¬ 
fessor Nicholson has thus translated one of the poems which 



IBN EL-ARABI: THE GREATEST SHEIKH 1 65 

most shocked the devout, who believed that theirs was the 
road to human salvation: 

My heart is capable of every form: 

A cloister for the monk, a fane for idols, 

A pasture for gazelles, the votary’s Ka’ba [temple]. 
The tables of the Torah, the Quran. 

Love is the creed I hold: wherever turn 
His camels, Love is still my creed and faith. 

The romantically minded person may take this as mean¬ 
ing that the familiar, quantitative kind of love with which 
his mind automatically associates these words is what the 
Greatest Sheikh means. For the Sufi, it is Sufism, of which 
the familiar “love,” is only a part, a limited part beyond 
which, under ordinary circumstances, the average person 
never goes. 


El-Ghazali of Persia 

The words used to denote "states” 
in S ufism are mere approximations. 

(Kalabadhi) 


While the Normans were consolidating their domains in 
Britain and Sicily, and the flow of Saracenic knowledge to 
the West was increasing through Arabized Spain and Italy, 
the empire of Islam was less than five hundred years old. 
The topheavy priesthood, whose functions were prohibited 
by the religious law but immensely powerful in fact, was 
desperately trying to reconcile Greek philosophical method 
with the Koran and the traditions of the Prophet. Having 
accepted scholasticism as the method whereby religion could 
be interpreted, these dialecticians yet found themselves un¬ 
able to demonstrate the truth of their beliefs by intellectual 
means. Society had, through the circulation of knowledge, 
outgrown formal dialectic. Excellent economic conditions 
had produced a large intelligentsia which needed more than 
dogmatic assurances or the assertion that the "State must be 
right.” Islam was the State. Islam seemed likely to fall apart. 

A young Persian of Meshed, known as Mohammed El- 
Ghazali (the Spinner), orphaned at an early age and 
brought up by Sufis, was at this time at college in Central 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA

Asia. He was destined to achieve two remarkable things, as 
a result of which both Islam and Christianity bear some of 
the characteristics which they still have today. 

Orthodox Islam was opposed to Sufism, which was re¬ 
garded as attempting to ignore the Law and substitute per¬ 
sonal experience of what religion really meant—a very 
heretical idea. But Mohammed El-Ghazali it was who proved 
the only man able to reconcile Islam with intellectualism 
and "fixed the ultimate creed of the Ashariyya and estab¬ 
lished its dicta as the universal creed of Islam," as Professor 
Hitti says. So successful was this heretic in becoming the 
virtual father of the Moslem church, that even the most 
orthodox still call him by the highest academic title known, 
the Authority of Islam. 

In under fifty years after their composition, his books 
were exerting a tremendous influence upon Jewish and 
Christian scholasticism. He not only anticipated in a re¬ 
markable fashion John Bunyan's Holy War and Pilgrim's 
Progress, but influenced Ram 6 n Marti, Thomas Aquinas 
and Pascal, as well as numerous more modem thinkers. 

Such books as the Destruction of the Philosophers, the 
Alchemy of Happiness and the Niche for Lights continue 
to be eagerly studied and contain a great deal of his teach¬ 
ings. 

Known in the middle ages in Europe as Algazel, Abu- 
Hamid Mohammed El-Ghazali took up the questions which, 
as more than one writer notes, the Christian theologians 
gratefully handed over to the Moslem thinkers; and he re¬ 
turned the answers, arrived at by what Professor Hitti 
calls the “mystico-psychological” answer of the Sufi. The ac¬ 
cepted position of Sufism, whereby it is acknowledged by 
many Moslem divines as the inner meaning of Islam, is a 
direct result of Ghazalfs work. 

The ideas which Ghazali passed on and which influenced 
both St. Thomas Aquinas the Dominican and St. Francis 
of Assisi, each in his own way, caused a confusion in the 
minds of writers on Western mysticism which endures to 



THE SUFIS 


168 

this day. To the Sufi, the Ghazalian stream in two different 
emphases is seen plainly in the work of both intellectual 
Dominicans and intuitive Franciscans. The two influences, 
separated because of the phenomenon of adaption and 
specialization in one Sufic method without the others, are 
so clearly definable that even if one did not know of any 
source for the inspiration of these Christian teachers, it 
would be possible to identify the Sufic stream. 

Evelyn Underhill (Mysticism) has managed to convey 
the underlying unity of the seemingly separate streams of 
the two Christian schools. Apparently without having heard 
of the Sufi influences on Christian mysticism, she is able 
to note that both the Dominican and Franciscans were 
basically rooted in contemplation, and “because of this were 
able to interpret to the medieval world the great spiritual 
traditions of the past." 

Ghazali, by using the Sufi concept that all religious and 
psychological activity is essentially of the same nature, rep¬ 
resenting a continuing tradition which can be furthered 
by certain individuals, arrived at the position where he could 
represent both the mystical and the theological worlds 
perfectly within their own contexts. In so doing, he was 
able to demonstrate the inner reality of religion and 
philosophy in such a way as to appeal to followers of any 
creed. The consequence was that, although his work was 
revered by followers of different traditions, there was a mis¬ 
taken tendency to assume that he had been attempting a 
synthesis of religion. A Christian theologian, Dr. August 
Tholuck, puts his work in these terms, while agreeing that 
Ghazali's writings should be acceptable to Christianity. 
Tholuck's remarks on this subject are well worth noting, 
for they give an excellent example of the “elephant in the 
dark” form of thinker, who cannot believe in a single source 
for all genuine metaphysical teaching, and must try to ac¬ 
count for the ingredients in any new appearance of a 
teacher: 

“All that is good, worthy and sublime, which his great 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA 169 

soul had compassed, he bestowed upon Mohammedanism, 
and he adorned the doctrines of the Koran with so much 
piety and learning that in the form given them by him, they 
seem, in my opinion, worthy of the assent of Christians, 
Whatever was most excellent in the philosophy of Aristotle 
or in the Sufi mysticism, he discreetly adapted to the Mo¬ 
hammedan theology. From every school he sought the means 
of shedding light and honor upon religion, while his 
sincere piety and lofty conscientiousness imparted to all his 
writings a sacred majesty." 

Hardly anything will shake the intellectualizing observer 
in his confidence that everything which he is studying is 
made up of a patchwork of other things. 

At a time when few divines were considered capable of 
reciting a tradition of the Prophet correctly unless they were 
graybeards, Ghazali appointed a professor at the famous 
Nizamiyya Academy at Baghdad at the age of thirty-three. 
His intellect was of such an order as to be unsurpassed in 
Islam. For him, the real object of education was not merely 
to provide information, but the stimulation of an inner con¬ 
sciousness—a concept too revolutionary for the scholastics 
of the time. He propounded this theory in his Ihya-el-ulum. 
As in the case of Rumi (who spoke of the limitations of 
poetry only when he had become a great poet) Ghazali 
could afford to show up scholasticism by the time he had no 
less than three hundred thousand traditions of the Prophet 
by heart, and was the Authority of Islam. 

His intellectual powers were yoked to a restlessness of 
mind which, as he says in his own autobiographical writ¬ 
ings, made him tirelessly investigate every dogma and every 
doctrine which he came across; and this from his early 
youth. 

While he was still teaching, Ghazali came to the con¬ 
clusion that canon law (on which he wrote authoritative 
books) was an insufficient basis for reality, and he lapsed 
into scepticism. 

Resigning his post, Ghazali spent twelve years—the tradi- 



THE SUFIS 


170 

tional dervish period-in wanderings and meditation, re¬ 
turning to his Sufi background for the answers which he 
did not find in the ordinary world. 

He confesses that he was an egoist, and craved applause 
and recognition. When he realized that this was a barrier 
to real understanding, he did not abruptly demean himself 
by choosing the "path of blame,” the panacea offered to 
many mystics. He decided that he would use conscious 
development in order to arrive at objective truth. 

During his period of detachment from the world, after 
he had abandoned his career as a scholastic, which had 
saved Moslem theology from decay, Ghazali relates how he 
battled with his Commanding Self. He had been wandering 
throughout the East, on pilgrimages and seeking enlighten¬ 
ment in the manner of the dervishes, when he entered a 
mosque. In the sermon, the Imam was ending his discourse 
with the words: "So speaks our leader Ghazali.” 

The wandering dervish said to himself, "O Commanding 
Self, how pleasant it is to you to hear this said! Yet I shall 
not tolerate this indulgence any more. I leave this place 
forthwith, to go where nobody talks of Ghazali.” 

The theologian, accepted master in matters of outer reli¬ 
gion, knew that the realization of what might be meant by 
the term "God” was something which could only be ap¬ 
preciated by inner means, not accessible through the frame¬ 
work of any formal religion. 

"I traveled to Syria,” he says, "and remained there for 
two years. I had no other objective than that of seeking 
solitariness, overcoming selfishness, fighting passions, trying 
to make dear my soul, to complete my character.” He did 
this because the Sufi cannot enter into understanding until 
his heart is prepared to "meditate upon God,” as he calls it. 

This period of time was sufficient only to give him 
sporadic flashes of spiritual fulfillment Cf° re taste)—the 
stage which is considered by most non-Sufi mystics to be 
the ultimate, but which is in fact only the first step. 

It had become dear to him that "the Sufis are not men of 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA 


171 

words, but of inner perception. I had learned all that could 
be learned by reading. The remainder could not be ac¬ 
quired by study or by talk/' 

Instead of being bemused by his ecstatic experiences, con¬ 
sidering them the be-all and end-all of the mystical quest, 
Ghazali realized that “the so-called absorption in God, con¬ 
sidered to be the goal of the Sufi, is in fact only the begin¬ 
ning/' 

He had exhausted scholasticism and intellectualism be¬ 
cause he realized that they had an end, and so he was able 
to exhaust the preliminary stages which passed as mystical 
experience in a final sense. He was able to do this because 
he attained what he sought—a form of cognition which, like 
a directing beam, gave him a sense of certitude and a means 
of reaching the ultimate realization. “It is something," he 
reports, describing this perception, “as specific as if one had 
actually touched an object.” 

Relating happiness and fulfillment to a process of 
alchemical transmutation of the human mind, Ghazali 
gives a story of Bayazid, one of the early classical Sufi mas¬ 
ters, in his Alchemy of Happiness , to stress how the amour 
propre (Commanding Self) must first be seen in its real 
light before any refining can actually be done: 

A man came to Bayazid and said that he had fasted 
and prayed for thirty years, and yet had not come near to an 
understanding of God. Bayazid told him that even a hun¬ 
dred years would not be enough. The man asked why. 

“Because your selfishness is working as a barrier between 
yourself and truth,” 

“Give me the remedy.” 

“There is a remedy, but it is impossible to you.” 

The man insisted, and Bayazid agreed to describe it to 
him. 

“Go and shave your beard. Strip yourself naked, except 
for a loincloth. Fill a nose bag full of walnuts and go to the 
marketplace. There cry out, A walnut for every boy who 



THE SUFIS

slaps meP Then make your way to the court where the doc¬ 
tors of law are in session.” 

“But I really could not do that. Give me some other 
method.” 

'This is the only method,” said Bayazid, “but I have al¬ 
ready told you, there is no answer for you.” 

Ghazali, like other dervish teachers, maintained that 
Sufism was the inner teaching of all religions, and he used 
many quotations from the Bible and Apocrypha to make his 
points. He wrote an early critical work on distortions in 
Christian ideals—El Qawl el Jamil fil Raddi a la man 
Ghayar el Injil. As a consequence, of course, he has been 
said to have been under Christian influence. He was, in 
fact, less so than even the British Broadcasting Corporation 
when it occasionally uses Sufi stories in its morning reli¬ 
gious program, probably deriving them from secondary 
sources, and using them in their esoteric sense when they 
accord with nominal Christianity. 

Ghazali was widely accused of preaching one thing and 
secretly teaching another. This is undoubtedly true, if it is 
accepted that he regarded active Sufism as a specialized un¬ 
dertaking suitable only for a limited number of people with 
the capacity for Adepthood. The external and doctrinal 
aspects of Islam which he enunciated with such impec¬ 
cable orthodoxy were intended for those who could not fol¬ 
low the inner Sufi Way. 

The Perfected Man (insani kamiV), because of his living 
in different dimensions at the same time, must appear to 
follow more than one set of doctrines. A man who is swim¬ 
ming across a lake is carrying out actions and responding 
to perceptions other than a man walking down a hill, for 
instance. He is the same man; and he carries with him when 
he is walking all the potentiality of swimming. 

With extraordinary bravery he actually states this in his 
Mizcm el Amal (Balances of Work). 

The Perfected Man has three frameworks of belief: 



EL-GHAZALI OP PERSIA 


173 


1. That of his surroundings. 

2. That which he conveys to students in accordance 

with their capacity for understanding. 

3. That which he understands from inner experience, 

only to be known among a special circle. 

His Mishkat el Anwar (Niche for Lights) is both a com¬ 
mentary on the famous light Verse of the Koran and a 
rendering of its initiatory significance. 1 

He explains that everything has an Outward and an In¬ 
ward significance. They do not operate together, though 
they both work consistently within their own dimensions. 
The version which is available in general circulation, it is 
true, does not contain the interpretation which is handed 
down by the present representatives of the dervish fra¬ 
ternities; but this is only because the key to this extraordi¬ 
nary book cannot be expressed in words, but is an exten¬ 
sion of personal experience. In other words, it cannot be 
understood unless it is experienced. 

This fact, a basic one in Sufism and stressed by numerous 
Sufi writers, may easily be misunderstood by formal thinkers. 
In a translation of the Niche made in English by the Di¬ 
rector of the School of Oriental Studies, Cairo, Mr. W. 
H. T. Gairdner speaks of the difficulty of understanding 
Ghazali on the subject of the point at which belief and dis¬ 
belief meet, and much else : 

“All these things are incommunicable mysteries, secrets, 
from the revealing of which our author (Ghazali) turns 
away at the exact moment when we expect the denouement. 
The art is supreme—but something more than tantalizing. 
Who were the Adepts to whom he did communicate these 
thrilling secrets? Were these communications ever written 
down for or by his brother initiates?" 

Ghazali is referring to secrets which are experienced, and 
cannot be written down. He is not trying to tantalize at all. 

There are really four parts of Ghazali's work. The first 

1 See annotation “Light Verse.” 


THE SUEIS 


174 

is the philosophical material which he placed at the disposal 
of Moslem theologians and intellectuals for the purpose of 
keeping the theoretical framework of the religion together. 
Then comes his metaphysical teachings as contained in such 
works as the Niche and the Alchemy . Afterward there are 
the meanings which are concealed in an enciphered form 
in his writings. Finally there is the teaching which extends 
from an understanding of the last two, which is partly 
transmitted orally and partly accessible to those who have 
followed correctly his mystical works and experiences. 

Like all the classical dervishes, Ghazali made use of 
poetic symbolism and encipherment. His surname, chosen 
by himself, is generally rendered “El-Ghazali." Primarily this 
means “the Spinner." This appellation denotes “one who 
spins, works with material such as wool"—the code word 
for Sufi —and carried the connotation of the need to spin, 
or work upon, one’s materials—and one’s self. Also by voca¬ 
tion association it is linked with Fatima (which means “the 
Dyer"), Mohammed’s daughter. From her all descendants 
of the Prophet trace their pedigree. They are believed to in¬ 
herit the inner teaching of Islam, showing where it connects 
with all genuine metaphysical traditions. 

The care with which these poetic names are chosen is 
shown by the numerous other associations of the work. 
Ghazali also stands for “gazelle" (the generic term for vari¬ 
ous types of antelope, such as the Oryx, which is a literal 
homonym for “a lover"). The three-letter root GH-Z-L from 
which the whole series of words is derived also produces 
the word GHaZaL, which itself is the standard Arabic and 
Persian technical term for a love poem, an amorous verse. 
Other derivations from this root include a spider’s web 
(something spun), which is in this case intended to be a 
reference to action coming through faith. The action was 
the spinning of a web across a cave mouth where Moham¬ 
med and his companion Abu Bakr were hiding from their 
enemies, on a famous occasion. 

A Sufi aware of these traditions therefore interprets El- 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA 1 75 

Ghazali's name in accordance with the principles on which 
it was chosen* To him, then, it means that Ghazali follows 
the path of Love, of Sufism (“wool”), which means work 
(spinning in this case). Ghazali has left these keynotes to 
be picked up by his successors, including the hint of the 
continuity of an inner doctrine (Fatima, the Dyer) within 
the religious context in which he lives. 

The methodology of Ghazali is followed in the traditional 
Sufi orders, with various variations. He defended the spe¬ 
cial use of music to elevate the perceptions in his Ihya —and 
music is used in this way in the Mevlevi and Chishti Orders 
of dervishes. The tune known in the West as Ravel's Bolero 
is actually an adaptation of one of these specially composed 
pieces. He points out that in order to develop higher facul¬ 
ties, self-pride must be recognized and overcome. This forms 
another part of Sufi training and study. He points out that 
the consciousness must be transmuted, rather than sup¬ 
pressed or distorted. 

It is this very use of the phraseology of alchemy by the 
Sufis of the middle ages which is responsible for a very great 
deal of confusion in the minds of later researchers as to what 
“alchemy” really does mean. Some say that it is a disguised 
form of a spiritual quest. Others reply that the laboratories 
of the alchemists have been examined and show every indi¬ 
cation of having been used for real experiments. Works at¬ 
tributed to spiritual alchemists have been described as 
chemical treatises. 

Thus Ghazali: “Alchemical gold is better than gold, but 
real alchemists are rare, and so are true Sufis. Who has but a 
smattering of Sufism is not superior to a learned man.” 
C Alchemy of Happiness ) 

First of all it should be remembered that a great part of 
the alchemical tradition of the West came through Arabic 
sources, and that the so-called Emerald Tablet of Hermes 
the Thrice-Greatest is found in its earliest form in Arabic. 
Further, the first classical Sufi was Jabir Ibn al-Hayyan, 



THE SUFIS 


I76 

surnamed the Sufi, the alchemist and occultist—the Latin 
Geber, who lived three centuries before Ghazali. 

The “Great Work” is a translated Sufi phrase, and the 
doctrine of the microcosm and macrocosm (what is above 
is equal to what is below) is also found in Sufi tradition, 
and expounded by Ghazali. As Sufism is not a mere inven¬ 
tion which took place at a certain point in time, it is in¬ 
evitable that similar ideas should occur in other genuine 
inner traditions. Unless all these points are firmly grasped, 
there can be no advantage in observing the theory of trans¬ 
mutation from coarse to fine from an adequate standpoint. 

Ghazalis Revival of Religious Sciences was publicly 
burned in Moslem Spain (before he had become the great¬ 
est religious authority in Islam) because it contained such 
statements as: 

The question of divine knowledge is so deep that it 
is really known only to those who have it. A child 
has no real knowledge of the attainments of an adult. 
An ordinary adult cannot understand the attainments 
of a learned man. In the same way, a learned man can¬ 
not understand the experiences of enlightened saints 
or Sufis. 

The Revival contains most important expositions of the 
Sufi love ideal. Affinity of humanity for each other and of 
humanity for creation is stressed. Quoting the Sufi master 
Malik ibn Dinar, Ghazali says, in Book IV: “Just as birds 
of the same feather fly together, two persons having a 
quality common to both will join.” 2 

Ghazali points out that a “mixture of a pig, a dog, a devil 
and a saint” is not a suitable basis for a mind which is at¬ 
tempting to attain deep understanding of things which this 
mixture by definition cannot attain. “You must stop look¬ 
ing at a cushion if you are trying to look at a lamp.” 

The way in which the unholy mixture is corrected, the

ings of Al-Ghazzali, Lahore, i960, p. 109. 



EL-GHA 2 ALI OF PERSIA 


177 

method whereby the mirror is aligned in order to reflect 
properly, must be known and must be practiced. This is 
the knowledge and the practice which is the result of the 
Sufi specialization. 

The specialized techniques of Sufism for arriving at the 
ability to learn and the learning itself, as well as the wis¬ 
dom which is ultimately attained, are the result of the cor¬ 
rect approach. “There are many degrees of knowledge," 
Ghazali stresses. “The mere physical man is like the ant 
crawling on paper, who observes black lettering and at¬ 
tributes its production to the pen and to nothing more." 
(Alchemy of Happiness ) 

What is the product of this specialization, as far as the 
ordinary world is concerned? Ghazali answers this in spe¬ 
cific terms in the Alchemy . Some people rule their own 
bodies. “Those individuals who reach a certain height of 
power rule their own bodies, and those of others as well. 
Should they desire an invalid to recover, he does so. . . . 
They can make someone come to them, by an effort of will." 

There are three qualities which are the consequence of 
Sufi specialization that can be expressed in terms percepti¬ 
ble to the ordinary reader: 

1. The power of extra perception, consciously exerted. 

2. The power to move bodies outside their own mass. 

3. Immediate consciousness of knowledge. Even that 
which is normally acquired only by labor becomes theirs 
by illumination or insight 

These faculties may appear to be separate or strange, but 
they are in fact only a part of a higher stage of being or 
existence, and can be recognized by ordinary people only in 
this crude way. “This interrelation cannot be explained in 
the usual way; just as in more mundane things we cannot 
explain the effect of poetry to one whose ear cannot accept 
it, or color to one who lacks the function of sight.” 

Man, Ghazali points out, is capable of existing on several 
different planes. He does not normally know enough about 
them to be able to differentiate. He is on one of four planes. 



THE SUFIS 


178 

"The first plane is when he is like a moth. It has sight, 
but no memory. It will be singed again and again on the 
same flame. The second is where he is like a dog. Once 
beaten, it will flee at the sight of a stick. The third is like 
that of a horse or a sheep. Both will run immediately, if 
they see a lion or a wolf, which are their natural foes. They 
will, however, not flee from a camel or a buffalo, even 
though both are much larger than their hereditary enemies.” 
The fourth plane is that in which man entirely transcends 
these animal limitations. He is now able to exercise some 
foresight. The relationship between these stages in respect 
of locomotion can be likened to: 

1. Walking on the land. 

2. Being on a ship. 

3. Riding in a chariot 

4. Walking on the sea. 

Beyond all these there is the phase in which one might 
say that the man can fly by his own power through the air. 

The commonalty remain in one of the first two stages. In 
these they do not endure as much as they should. Being 
static, they are invariably inimical to those who are in 
movement. 

In his metaphysical work, Ghazali seldom troubles him¬ 
self to exhort people to follow the Sufi path. In one passage, 
however, he does emphasize one argument. If, he says, what 
the Sufis are saying is true—that there is an urgent under¬ 
taking in life which bears a relationship with one's future 
state—it will matter very much in the future state. If, on 
the other hand, there is no such relationship, nothing will 
matter. Therefore, he asks, is it not better to give this point 
of view the benefit of the doubt? Later it will be too late. 

Ghazali next turns in his Alchemy to the question of 
music in its psychological aspects. He notes the mechanism 
whereby music and dancing can be used for excitatory pur¬ 
poses. Music can be a method of producing emotional ef¬ 
fect. He maintains, however, that there is an innocent 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA 179 

function of music, in which it does not produce the pseudo¬ 
religious sentiments used by undiscriminating cults. 

The Sufi use of music is different from the emotional use. 
Before a Sufi can participate in musical activities, including 
listening to music, it must be established by his director as 
to whether he will benefit correctly from the experience. 

A story is related here to show how a Sufi teacher 
(Sheikh Gurjani) explained that a certain disciple was not 
yet fitted for the audition of music in the Sufi, objective, 
sense. In response to his request, the Sheikh said, “Fast for 
a week. Have delicious food cooked for you. If you then 
still prefer musical movement, take part in it." 

Participation in music and “dancing" under any other 
circumstances is, says Ghazali, not only forbidden; it is 
actually harmful to the aspirant. Modem psychology has 
not yet realized that there is a special function of sound for 
elevating consciousness. 

The reality of the true “state" of Sufi experience is 
very difficult to grasp for the outsider, because he is ac¬ 
customed to thinking in terms which are different from 
this state. “Allowances must be made for him," Ghazali 
says, “because he is unaware of what these states are. It is 
like a blind man trying to understand the experience of 
seeing green herbage or running water." 

At best the outsider can only relate the experience which 
is reported to him in terms of his own experiences—sensual, 
orgiastic, emotional. “Yet a wise man will not deny such 
states simply because he has not experienced them; because 
this form of opinion forming is disastrously foolish." 

The deist view of the so-called mystical experience, which 
carries no superior knowledge but is merely a form of auto¬ 
intoxication, is not the one which Ghazali is trying to por¬ 
tray. Still less is he inclined to accept the contention that 
there is any sort of a descent of deity into man. The whole 
reportage is vitiated, and may even be voided, by the attempt 
to transpose it into a vehicle—words—which will not ade¬ 
quately convey it. A Sufi commentator on Ghazali notes 


THE SUEIS 


180 

that things which are comprehensive experiences “cannot 
be penned by a mumbling wordsmith, any more than he 
himself would accept a paper copy of a fruit as edible or 
nutritious." 

The intellectual or externalist attempt to understand 
something vicariously, to force into a word pattern some¬ 
thing which is beyond it, is “like someone who, seeing his 
face in a mirror, imagines that his face has in some way 
become imprisoned in a mirror." 

In dervish meetings, there are examples of ecstatic con¬ 
vulsions and other signs of false experience or states. Once, 
Ghazali recalls, the great Sheikh Junayd reprimanded a 
youth who fell into frenzy at a Sufi meeting. “Never do 
that again, or leave my company," Junayd told him. Sufi 
belief is that outward evidences like this of supposedly 
inner changes are counterfeit or merely emotional. True 
experience carries no physical concomitant of this kind— 
whether it be “speaking in tongues" or rolling on the floor* 
The illustrious Mahmud Shabistari, in his Secret Garden, 
comments: “If thou know not these states, pass on, nor 
join the infidel in ignorant counterfeit. . . . But all learn 
not the secrets of the Way." 

These demonstrations are, in a way, associated with the 
emotional use of words which is the shortcoming and ulti¬ 
mately the downfall of the formal religions. Making phrases 
connected with God, faith, or any religion is an external, 
at best an emotional, matter. This is one reason why Sufis 
will not discuss Sufism in the same context as religion. Difr 
ferent planes are involved. 

Once there has been an inner experience of what is 
meant by the familiar phraseology of religion, the phrases 
cease to have any meaning at all, because the transition 
from the coarse to the finer has taken place. Ghazali illus¬ 
trates this fact by a report. The Sufi master Fudayl (died 
801) said: “If asked whether you love God, say nothing. 
This is because if you say, 1 do not love God/ you are an 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA l8l 

unbeliever. If, on the other hand, you say, 1 do love God/ 
your actions contradict you.” 

If a person knows what religious love is, he will express 
it in its own way, not in a way which is familiar to those 
who do not know. Everyone will be uplifted or the reverse 
in accordance with his own capacities and that with which 
he is familiar. Ghazali reports that a man collapsed in a 
perfume bazaar. People tried to revive him with sweet odors. 
Presently someone who knew him said, “I have been a dust¬ 
man. This man is also one. He will be revived by the smell 
of that which is familiar to him.” Accordingly some nauseat¬ 
ing substance was held under his nose, and he immediately 
revived. 

This kind of contention is generally anathema to those 
who seek to attribute familiar sensations to a higher order 
of being, and assume that they are experiencing at least 
some measure of the divine or mystical in forms which are 
nothing more than grosser ones. The grosser form is suitable 
to its context, and cannot be transposed. A petrol engine 
cannot be run on butter, even though butter is in its own 
place a very excellent thing. Nobody would think of refer¬ 
ring to it seriously as petrol, however. The Sufi doctrine 
of a continuum of refinement of matter will here be seen 
to be quite different from that of other systems. The other 
two schools hold that materiality must either be shunned 
altogether, or that it must be made use of. In actual fact, 
every degree of materiality has its own function; and ma¬ 
teriality extends in successive refinement until it becomes 
what has been generally considered to be separate-spirit. 

Ghazali enunciated the doctrine that it is necessary to 
realize the multiple functions, at different levels, of what 
appears to be the same thing; e.g.: “The eye may see the 
large as small: the sun as the size of a bowl. . . . Intelli¬ 
gence understands that the sun is in fact many times larger 
than the earth. . . . The faculties of imagination and 
fantasy often produce beliefs and pass judgments which 
they consider to be products of the intelligence. The error

is consequently in the lower mental processes to the un¬ 
wary or insensitive.” ([Niche of Lights, first part.) By in¬ 
sensitive he means those who do not allow themselves to 
feel multiple impact and meaning. Among numerous illus¬ 
trations of the working of this tendency, he says in his 
Revival some important things about the self. 

The self means in one sense the personality of man, 
which is used to handle outside impacts and employ them 
for gratification. But it also means the inner or essential 
quality of the individual. In this capacity its formal name 
changes in accordance with its functions. If the essence 
operates correctly in reorganizing the emotional life and pre¬ 
venting confusion, it is known as the Peaceful Self. Operat¬ 
ing in the field of conscience, when it is activated to re¬ 
mind the man or woman of certain matters, it is called the 
Accusatory Self. There has been tremendous confusion in 
this matter, because for purposes of examination and teach¬ 
ing, the essential self has to be given a name. Yet its dif¬ 
fering modes of operation according to what work it is 
performing can give the impression that it is a number of 
different things; or even that it is at different stages of de¬ 
velopment It is legitimate to represent the process as being 
composed of stages, but this is at best only an illustrative 
distinction. The Sufi whose consciousness is operating cor¬ 
rectly will regard the different phases of the essence's trans¬ 
mutation in a special and distinctive way, not adequately 
duplicated in familiar terminology. When the essence is 
operating in a way normal to undeveloped man, it gives 
its potential to the mechanism which indulges primitive 
satisfactions, and is then known as the Commanding Self. 

"Certain conditions,” he stresses, "are easily understood 
and give the impression that everything can similarly easily 
be understood. But there are situations which can only be 
understood by those who see them in a certain [special] 
way. The ignorance of this [mechanism] gives rise to the 
common fault of assuming an uniformity in events.” 

In common with other Sufi teachers, Ghazali finds that 



EL-GHAZALI OF PERSIA 183 

he has to repeat his argument in different forms as his text 
demands it. This is partly because the Sufi method may 
require the same standpoint to be taken up in different sets 
of ideas. It is also because, as is so often seen in study 
groups, people may give lip service to an important con¬ 
tention, yet not be permeated with it. The contention must 
actually operate as a dynamic force within the mind of the 
student. In many cases, because he is accustomed to being 
conditioned or trained, the student will accept a contention 
as a conditioning. The result of this will be that he merely 
thinks that he has absorbed it, because he responds in a 
predictable way whenever a certain stimulus of contention 
is applied to him. Such conditioning, if it has taken place, 
must be broken before the Sufi effect can manifest itself. 

The misunderstanding involved in the use of the terms 
“Son of God” (attributed to Jesus) and “I am the Truth” 
(said by the Sufi Hallaj ) 3 is due entirely to this question. 
The attempt to express a certain relationship in language 
not prepared for it causes the expression to be misunder¬ 
stood. 

The individual, Ghazali says in the Revival , may pass 
through stages of interior development analogous to those 
of human growing up. This gradual development causes 
his experiences to take different forms. Hence, a Sufi may 
not need a certain physical experience because his develop¬ 
ment has substituted a capacity for a more coherent, better 
experience. “Every stage of life, for example, is marked by 
a fresh land of enjoyment. Children like playing and have 
no conception of the pleasures of marriage which they will 
develop the capacity for later. The adult, in his turn, will 
in his younger days have no capacity for the enjoyment of 
riches and greatness which is experienced by the middle- 
aged. The latter, in their turn, may consider earlier de¬ 
lights as much less significant than their current ones. More 
developed individuals, of course, will consider incomplete, 
impalpable or sporadic the conventionally familiar indul-

doubtful whether any Sufis were asked as to what they

preciation.” I 

The alternation of allegories, which prevents their be- | 
coming crystallized into mere conditioning mechanisms, is 
a common procedure in the living teaching of Sufi schools, j 
Ghazali in his works often changes his teaching in an out¬ 
ward sense, while the inner meaning remains the same. In \ 
his Minhaj el-Abidin, he treats of the progress of the al¬ 
chemizing of the consciousness in seven “valleys” of experi- 1 
ence—the Valleys of Knowledge, Turning Back, Obstacles, ; 
Tribulations, Lightning, Abysses and Praise. This is the j 
more theological frame of projection of the Sufi message, j j 
and forms die medium through which the Moslem and 
Christian devout of the middle ages was able to gain a 
glimpse of Sufi teaching. It is interesting to note that Bun- 
yan and Chaucer used this Sufi material, drawing heavily j 
upon its imagery to provide a stiffening for Catholic think- | 
ing. Eastern teachers such as Attar and Rumi maintained j j 
contact with the more direct stream of meaning of the 
“quest” theme; probably because they were practical, as well j 
as theoretical, teachers with their own schools. 

Man’s happiness undergoes successive refinements in ac- j 
cordance with his “state of being,” according to Ghazali. I 
This teaching, which will not accept the usual human view | 
that there is one standard form of happiness, an abstraction, j 
is a marked feature of Sufi lore. j 

“Man contains diverse possibilities, each responding to its 
own type of enjoyment. Initially there is the physical one. 

In a similar way there is the moral faculty, which I call real 
reason, which enjoys the attainment of as much knowledge 
as possible. There are thus the outward and inward indul-1 
gences. In accordance with their refinement, so will they be 
preferred. 

“A man, then, who has a capacity for acceptance of a 
perfection of Being will prefer the contemplation of this. 
Even in the present life the happiness of the right-seekers is ? 3 
incomparably greater than can be imagined.” 








Omar Khayyam 


True devotion is for itself: not to 
desire heaven nor to fear hell. 

(Rabia el-Adawia) 


The quatrains of Omar, son of Abraham the Tentmaker, 
lave been translated into almost every language in the 
vorld. Nothing in his reputed life as schoolfellow of the 
*reat Assassin, friend of Nizam the Great Vizier, courtier 
ind epicure, is as unlikely as the adventures which have 
&gt;efallen him in translation. It has become a commonplace 
hat the Rubaiyat translated by FitzGerald more faithfully 
epresents the Irish poet than the Persian. Yet this is itself 
i superficial assessment, because Omar represents not him- 
elf but a school of Sufi philosophy. It is necessary not only 
o know what Omar really said, but what he meant by it. 

There is a further interest in the fact that in amalgamat- 
ng ideas from several Sufi poets and putting them out in the 
lame of Omar, FitzGerald unconsciously maintained a 
iufic impact in English literature. 

Let us start with FitzGerald's translating. In Quatrain 55, 
le makes Omar speak specifically against the Sufis: 

The Vine had struck a Fibre; which about 
If clings my Being—let the Sufi flout;

point of view, since Omar was not the teacher of a school

OMAR KHAYYAM 


187 

the question is void of importance. Much interest has been 
shown by literary researchers in the possible influence upon 
Omar of the blind poet Abu el-Ali el-Maari. In the Luzutn, 
written a generation before Khayyam, Maari published very 
similar poetry which is said to be reminiscent of Khayyam. 

Maari wrote like Khayyam, and Khayyam like Maari, a 
Sufi would say, because they were both writing from the 
point of view of the same school. Khayyam probably copied 
Maari just as much as two swimmers copy each other if they 
swim together, having learned, separately or together, from 
the same source. 

This is the impasse which develops when one party (the 
literary) is looking at one facet of a work, and another party 
(the mystic) at the intention or influence within a certain 
context. 

Khayyam is the Sufi voice, and the Sufi voice, to the Sufi, 
is timeless. In poetry it will not submit readily to time- 
centered theories. That Khayyam has been rediscovered in 
Persian through the fame of translations is correct—if we 
amend this to read, “Khayyam was not well known to non- 
Sufis until comparatively recently in Persia. However, 
through the efforts of Western scholars, his work has be¬ 
come known very widely to non-Sufis there.” 

Professor Cowell, who introduced Omar to FitzGerald, 
and taught him Persian, found the Sufi content in Khayyam 
through talks with Indian scholars of Persian. Some later 
scholars have concluded that these people misled the pro¬ 
fessor. Some Western experts will have no Sufic content in 
Khayyam. The Reverend Dr. T. H. Weir, a lecturer in 
Arabic (Khayyam wrote in Persian), wrote a book about 
Omar in which he is quite clear about this. “The truth is,” he 
says (in his Omar Khayyam the Poet), “that one cannot 
read half a dozen lines of Omar without seeing that there is 
no mysticism here, any more than in Bums.” He does not tell 
us what kind of mysticism he is referring to, or how he 
would identify it. 

FitzGerald himself was confused about Omar. Some- 



THE SUEIS 


188 

times he thought that he was a Sufi, sometimes not. But he 
had himself absorbed a great deal of Sufi thought. Heron- 
Alien, who made a most careful analysis, shows that mate¬ 
rial which people had thought was concocted by FitzGerald 
often came from other Persian poets. These authors were 
the ones which have since Chaucer most influenced English 
writers—the Sufis Attar, Hafiz, Saadi and Jami. 

Perhaps intentionally but probably accidentally, Fitz¬ 
Gerald had become soaked in Sufic teachings from what 
are Persian basic texts. These matured in his mind until 
they emerged, mixed with Omar, to form the Rubaiyat in 
English. Had FitzGerald known about the special teaching 
technique used by Khayyam—following up a line of thought 
in order to imply its shallowness—he might have provided 
something even more effective in its impact 

The translator also missed the stress placed by Khayyam 
on the Sufic state of understanding which comes after “in¬ 
ebriation,” contained in such passages at this: 

I cannot live without wine, 

Without the cup’s draught I cannot carry my body. 

I am the slave of that breath in which the Saki says 

“Take one more cup”—and I cannot do so. 

This is a clear reference to the condition attained under 
Sufi teachers when what was an ecstatic experience develops 
into a real perception of the hidden dimension beyond the 
metaphorical drunkenness. 

FitzGerald’s version of Khayyam has never been improved 
upon in English because, in order for Sufi ideas to be trans¬ 
mitted to any extent in any generation, there must be a 
certain measure of harmony between the ideas and the for¬ 
mulation of the time. 

This is not to say that everyone could see this content in 
Omar. He captured Swinburne, Meredith and millions of 
people seeking a way of thinking outside the conventions 
within which they felt themselves imprisoned. But others 
sensed that this was in some way a threat to convention. A 



OMAR KHAYYAM 189 

celebrated doctor of divinity, Dr. Hastie, did not attempt 
to understand the depth in Khayyam. 

He found the FitzGerald version “of the rudest wit and 
shallowest reflection, lean and flashy songs." FitzGerald him¬ 
self had produced a “new-patched Omar;” exciting “miser¬ 
able, self-deluded, unhealthy fanatics of his Cult." This 
“cult" was “a literary craze and delusion, infatuation and 
spurious idolatry." 

Did the reverend gentleman feel his values threatened by 
one who was, after all, only a “tipsy toper, cowardly scamp, 
bankrupt, blustering purblind braggart?" 

Omar was perhaps as often understood in the East as in 
the West Perturbed because so many English-speaking 
Moslem students in India were enthused over Khayyam in 
FitzGerald's translation, at least one orthodox Moslem 
divine circulated a warning. In The Explanation of Khay¬ 
yam (Molvi Khanzada, Lahore, 1929), a widely circulated 
pamphlet, he did what he could to fit the problem into 
his own perspective. First he argues, not without reason, 
that FitzGerald did not know Persian really well. Secondly, 
he insists that Cowell did not know it well either (“both 
scrawled badly, like small children"). People who wanted 
to read Khayyam should study Persian first, not English. 
Even before Khayyam they would then be able to get a 
proper basis of Islam before passing on to complicated mat¬ 
ters like Sufism. Finally, Khayyam is a generic term applied 
to a way of teaching which the Sufis have and which would 
in any case be misleading if taken on its own, out of books 
and without a master. 

Khayyam was a great cult in England. His devotees 
formed clubs, planted roses from Nishapur on FitzGerald's 
grave, sought to emulate him in their poetry. The literary 
cult multiplied, in spite of the fact that it was known that 
the oldest available manuscript was written three hundred 
and fifty years after its author's death—almost as if all we 
knew about St. John of the Cross was in a document

written yesterday, and we had to base our assessment of him 
on that and very little else. 

From the Sufi point of view, Khayyam’s poetry has multi¬ 
ple functions. It may be read for its apparent content alone; 
it may be recited under certain conditions in order to provide 
special improvements in the range of consciousness; it may 
be "decoded" to obtain material of use in Sufic studies. 

It is a part of the Sufi heritage, and as such performs a 
comprehensive role whose understanding is itself a part of 
Sufi specialization. 

It is reported of Khan Jan-Fishan Khan, chief of the 
Hindu-Kush Sufis and a great nineteenth-century master, 
that he used the quatrains of Omar in his teaching. A 
disciple reports: 

Three new members came to the Khan. He received them, 
told them to go away and study Khayyam, then to report 
on him . In a week they reported, on his reception day. The 
first said that the effect of the poems had been to make him 
think and to think as he had not thought before. The sec¬ 
ond said that he thought Khayyam a heretic. The third felt 
that there was some deep mystery in Khayyam, which he 
hoped he would eventually be able to understand. 

The first was kept on as a disciple. The second was sent 
to another teacher. The third was sent back to study Khay¬ 
yam for another week. A disciple asked the Khan whether 
this was a method of assessing the potentialities of the 
would-be Sufis. "We already knew somet h i n g about them, 
through intuitive means," said the master, "but what you 
consider a test is partly a test and partly a fragment of their 
training. Further, it has the function of helping to train the 
watchers as well. This is Sufism—it is a composite, if you 
like, of study, feeling and the interaction of people and 
thought." 

I was present one day when an enthusiastic German fol¬ 
lower of Omar read a complicated and wordy analysis of 
Khayyam and his sources to a Sufi master. Beginning with 
the contention that Omar was discovered by von Hammer 



OMAR KHAYYAM 


I 9 I 

almost forty years before Cowell and FitzGerald, he ended 
by showing to his own satisfaction that almost every type of 
philosophical theory was embodied in the Rubaiyat . The 
sage listened to him in complete silence. Then he told a 
story, and here it is. 

A scholar went to a Sufi master and asked him about the 
seven Greek philosophers who fled to Persia from the 
tyranny of Justinian, who had closed their philosophical 
schools. “They were of our number,” replied the Sufi. 

Delighted, the scholar went away and wrote a treatise on 
the Greek origins of Sufic thought. 

One day he met a traveling Sufi, who said, “The master 
Halimi and the great Rumi quote Jesus as a Sufi teacher.” 

“Perhaps he means that the Greek knowledge passed to 
the Christians and also to the Sufis,” thought the scholar. 
He wrote this into his treatise. 

The original master, on a pilgrimage, passed through the 
scholar's hometown one day. Meeting him, he said, “And 
the heretics, and thousands who do not know it, are of our 
number.” 1 

My friend, the Sufi, looked closely at the German scholas¬ 
tic. “Wine contains water, sugar, fruit, color. Mix these to¬ 
gether and you will not produce wine. 

“We are sitting in a room. Suppose a man said, ‘The 
Chinese have rooms. Therefore all rooms are copied from 
them. There is a carpet here. This means Mongol influence. 
A servant just entered—this, surely is a Roman habit. Or is 
it a Pharaonic one? Now, through the window I see a bird. 
Research has shown that birds were almost certainly seen 
through windows by ancient Egyptians. What a wonderful 
amalgam of inherited customs this place is!' What would you 
think of such a man?”

tory of Persia , who quotes a traditional tale about the poet, 
supposed to prove that he believed in reincarnation. 

The poet was one day about to pass an old college in 
Nishapur, accompanied by a group of his students. A 
string of donkeys, carrying bricks for the repair of the build¬ 
ing, entered. One, however, refused to pass through the 
gates. Omar looked at the scene, smiled and went up to the 
donkey, reciting an extempore poem: 

O one who has gone and returned, 

Your name has been lost from among names. 

Your nails are combined into hooves: 

Your beard, a tail, now on the other end. 

The ass now readily entered the college grounds. The 
disciples, puzzled, asked their teacher, “Wise one, what does 
this mean?” 

“The spirit which is now within that ass was once inside 
the body of a teacher in this college. It was reluctant to go in 
as a donkey. Then, finding that it had been recognized by 
a fellow teacher, it had to enter the precincts.” 

But Omar was not (as has been thought by externalists) 
indicating a possibility that some element of human entity 
might attach itself to another living form. Neither was he 
just taking an opportunity of tilting at the sterile scholasti¬ 
cism of his time. Nor was he showing that he could influ¬ 
ence donkeys by means of verse. 

If he was not showing off in front of his disciples, not 
playing a joke, not carrying out some private activity 
mysterious to the unenlightened onlooker, not preaching 
a form of reincarnation, not essentially versifying—what 
was he doing? 

He was doing what all Sufi teachers do—applying a com¬ 
plex impact for the benefit of the students, allowing them to 
participate in the fact of accompanying a teacher through 
a comprehensive experience. This is a form of demonstrative 
communication which is known only to those who have 
been through the rough-and-tumble of a Sufi school. The

moment the process is split up by the inquiring mind, in an 
attempt to relate it to a single, even a double, rational 
meaning, the meaning itself drops away. 

The disciple learns through this method things which 
cannot be conveyed by any other. Reproduce them in print, 
and unless you add a caution, trying to indicate their spe¬ 
cial character, the situation will appear to the most earnest 
inquirer as obscure at best. 

The name which Omar chose for his own—Omar Khay¬ 
yam—decodes by numerical cipher to Ghaqi —Squanderer of 
Goods; a name used for a man who does not care for the 
ordinary things of this world, when dissipation of attention 
upon them prevents his developing of meaningful percep¬ 
tion of another dimension. 

One of Omars most telling poems against mechanical 
thinkers—academic or emotional—might still be used with 
every justification to reproach his later self-appointed critics 
and expounders: 

O ignorant ones—the Road is neither this nor that!

Neither Sufism in translation of its literary forms nor the 
writings of many Eastern poets can be well understood with¬ 
out a knowledge of the secret language (the "hidden 
tongue”) which is used to communicate ideas and concepts. 
Literal translation of Sufi words or encoded terms has caused 
an almost unbelievable confusion in the West, especially 
in the transmission of "secret lore.” The problem started in 
its literary form in the twelfth century, when the allegorical 
alchemies were translated. It continues in almost unbroken 
succession to the present day, when Sufi books are still ap¬ 
pearing with a literal interpretation given to what are in 
fact poetic complications, so written as to be dear only to the 
Sufi. 

It is impossible to give a full account of all the systems 
used in secret-language form by the Sufis. But we can point 
out some cases, examples which make the idea dear and 
also shed light on puzzles still lingering in the West. 

First we must go into the matter a little further. 

The illustrious poet Nizami, in his Treasury of Mysteries,

is one of the many who have referred to the cryptography 
of the Sufis, It is a form of communication among the en¬ 
lightened ones. It has the advantage of connecting mun¬ 
dane thinking with the greater dimensions, the "other world” 
from which ordinary humanity is cut off. The language will 
vary in its formulation according to the time and culture 
in which it is used, but its essence and working remain the 
same. 

In classical Sufi times this language is based upon Arabic, 
though examples of pre-Islamic use of the system are to be 
found. 

Nizami, in one poem, gives this clue about the language: 

A time will come when our die is stamped on a new 
coin. [The Sufi speech] does not belong to any 
known tongue. Under the poet's tongue lies the key 
to the Treasury . The prophet and the poet are the 
kernel: others the shell. 

The secret language, because it is not only a cipher to 
prevent the profane from understanding things with which 
they cannot correctly attune themselves, and because it is 
thought to connect with a greater reality, is immensely com¬ 
plicated in effect It is the subject of Sufi study in the circles 
of the teachers, and once its method of procedure is under¬ 
stood, at least one layer of its working is revealed. If we 
look at the extract from Nizami, we see how double mean¬ 
ing is used to throw the ordinary literary reader off the scent 
"Our die . . . stamped on a new coin” may be taken to 
mean a life to come, or even the possibility of reincarnation. 
But this automatic association is not intended thus. Follow¬ 
ing, in the original Persian, the basic knowledge that the 
passage is a clue, we find that the “key to the Treasury” is 
the tide of the book itself. (The Treasury of Mysteries ) In 
a secondary sense it may be taken to mean a treasury of 
knowledge, but our poet is being more specific. 

The secret language, although it has expression in the 
familiar world, is considered to be in a special relationship 



Z p6 the SUFIS 

with the extrafamiliar one. Hence it is in its literary expres¬ 
sion both an art form and also a lead-in to the reaches where 
there is no “known tongue.” 

If we return to an earlier stage in encipherment, the basic 
system is the Abjad scheme, a fairly simple substitution 
cipher, often coupled with allegorization of the recipher- 
ment. This is widely used in literature. Many people read 
it, or at least look for it, almost as a matter of course, 
especially poets and writers. Hebrew and Arabic both use 
similar numerical equivalents for the Semitic letters, also 
now applied to many other languages. These are the letters 
and their equivalents:

While the Arabic letters have equivalents up to one 
thousand, the Hebrew alphabet has equivalents only up to 
four hundred, inclusive. For mnemonic purposes this ar¬ 
rangement of letters is always memorized as follows, as a 
string of meaningless words, adding diacritical points to 
make pronunciation possible: 

ABJAD HAWAZ HUTY KALMAN SAFAS 
QURSHAT THAKHDZ DHATZAGH. 

In Persian, Urdu and other non-Semitic languages, the 
letters are given slightly different sounds in some cases, but 
this does not affect the use of the letters, whose numerical 
values remain constant.

Date names, dates of birth or death, words expressing the 
character or aspirations of a person, all are often evolved 
from the scheme. Ignorant repetition of the meaningless 
words has in some places endowed the barbarous Abjad 
“words” with spurious baraka, the belief in special inherent 
functions, but this belongs to the realm of repetitious magi¬ 
cal procedures and is not important 

Here is an example of how one might use the scheme. 
Supposing that we want to name a book, showing that it 
has a certain sort of disguised content, perhaps records of 
secret processes. We could name it Source of Records, in 
Arabic Umm el Qissa . We examine the words which we 
have chosen, with their meanings: 

UMM = mother, matrix, source, principle, prototype 

EL = of 

QISSA = record, story, tale 

Umm el Qissa, we now see, may mean something equiva¬ 
lent to: Mother of Records, Source of Story, Prototype of 
Tales. We now, if all these alternatives are agreeable to us, 
encipher the letters by substituting their numerical equiva¬ 
lents from the standard Abjad list. Now we add them to¬ 
gether. The sum is 267. 

Now we have to find a sufficiently descriptive or poetic 
title for our book, made up of letters which, when added, 
give us the same number 267. 

Our rearrangement can give us the phrase: Alf layla wa 
layla. This means Thousand and One Nights . The title of a 
book, or the author’s name, will often give a most important 
indication of the emphasis which is to be placed upon the 
book, and what can be discovered from it. In the case of the 
Arabian Nights, the person who named the work intended 
to convey that herein would be found certain essential 
stories. A study of the stories themselves, and their decoding 
according to the rules of the secret language, gives us the in¬ 
tention or concealed meaning and use of the stories. Many 
of them are encoded Sufi teaching stories, descriptions of 



THE SUFIS 


I98 

psychological processes, or enciphered lore of one kind or 
another. 

However complicated all this may appear, in fact the in¬ 
vestigation is inevitable and not difficult for anyone who is 
working with this kind of material. Most people who do so 
have been coached in the methodology by their own 
teachers. It can be said to be a part of Sufi literary training 
—the point at which literature is shown to be the vehicle for 
much more complex experiences than those on the literary 
level as usually understood. 

We can now look at the mysterious word “Sufi,” itself the 
subject of puzzlement and questioning. Decoded by the 
scheme, we find it to be made up as follows: 

S = 90; W = 6; F = 80; Y = 10. These are the conso¬ 
nants used in the spelling of the word. They total 186. In 
order to decode, we have to arrange the numbers in hun¬ 
dreds, tens and units: 100, 80, 6. These are now retrans¬ 
formed into their equivalent letters: 100 = Q; 80 = F; 
6 = U. These can be rearranged in any of several ways, to 
form three-letter roots in Arabic, all indicative of some aspect 
of Sufism. The main interpretation is FUQ, which means 
“Above, transcending.” Sufism is, as a consequence, spoken 
of as the Transcendent philosophy. 

The names of Sufi authors and teachers have been chosen 
with the greatest care. They represent a quality, formulation 
or emphasis which it is intended should be read into their 
works, or at least the work in which they appear. 

Sufis therefore do not approach their teachers' names ex¬ 
ternally, as the product of their environment (Bokhara, 
Arabia, and so on); nor as indications of professions (the 
Chemist, Painter, Spinner). Their names have first to be 
decoded. 

Attar, for instance, means the Chemist, or the Seller of 
Perfumes. On the poetical level, such a name is sufficiently 
descriptive. Decoded, to gain the essence of the name, we 
have the number 280. Restoring the numbers to their order 
of greatness (hundreds, then tens), we have 200 and 80. 



THE COALMEN

Reconverting into letters: 200 = R; 80 = F. The word 
which represents the essence Qdhat) is RF. The dictionary 
shows us that in Arabic this word stands for the concept 
of “the fluttering of a bird.” Attar’s masterpiece The Parlia¬ 
ment of the Birds is a reference to this. More than this, he 
has chosen the RF root to convey its alternative meanings: 
“to flash (light); to twinkle; shining (color); to be shaken by 
the wind.” 

The flash refers to intuition, the shining to the projection 
of teaching and the use of colors by the Sufis. The shaking, 
used in this root as of a plant in the wind, means the move¬ 
ment of the exercises of the dervish. Attar further chooses 
the plant allegory because Sufism is of a growing, adaptive, 
organic and necessary nature, according to its followers. The 
wind which is taken as shaking the plant is the divine wind, 
the impalpable force which is known by its effect (on the 
plant) as much as by anything else. 

Shams of Tabriz, the inspirer of some of Rumis poetry 
and at one time his associate, is a mysterious figure to the 
externalist He is referred to in literature under the sobri¬ 
quet of zardoz, Persian for “worker in golden thread,” people 
having in consequence inferred that this was his mundane 
occupation. His whole name was Shamsuddin-i-Tabriz. 
When it is decoded, we find that this was a poetic name, 
carefully chosen by the Abjad method. His real name, con¬ 
verted and reconverted into letters, spells khit, “thread, 
string,” and is connected with gossamer and also the particles 
which seem to dance in the sun’s rays. Since his name 
“Shams” also means “sun” when literally translated, the play 
upon words becomes obvious. His other names, such as 
parinda (the Flyer) can be similarly decoded to produce 
meaningful descriptions. 

In initiatory words, the Abjad provides even more pro¬ 
found meanings, familiar to every practicing Sufi. No per¬ 
son may be a teacher of Sufism unless he has himself been 
through the succession of experiences which are essential. 
When he has been through these, he is changed, so that he 



200 


THE SUFIS 


re mains an ordinary human being only in the obvious sense. 
His functions have changed, and he is now a “herdsman. 
What is it that gives him that character? It is a cognition 
which is called “certitude," which the Sufi illuminate, the 
“arrived man," or “whole one," now possesses. In this he 
differs from the ordinary man, who is a prey to the fluctua¬ 
tions of his own lack of stabilization. This is expressed in 
the derivations of the word for certitude. 

Certitude stands for infallible guidance, and the word for 
it is yaqina, formed of the elements YQN. These are trans¬ 
posed into 160, split again into ioo and 60, reconverted into 
QSS. The dictionary shows that this word stands for “taking 
the marrow out of a bone." It can also mean “herdsman,” or 
“to become a priest." Sufis therefore consider that the es¬ 
sence of certitude and its expression is the “retrieving of the 
very marrow, the shepherding of others, the exercising the 
commanding authority and endowment usually invested in 
what is called a priest in mechanical religion." It may be 
noted that the Sufi cannot benefit another person beyond 
the extent to which his function is acknowledged by that 
person. As a shepherd he can look after the external needs 
of a flock; as a priest he has the inner qualities to cater for 
their essential progress. This, to the Sufi, is the meaning of 
priest—that he should have arrived at some sort of certitude 
which places him into contact with the greater dimension, 
not that he should be mechanically created by order or 
study. A priest is the result of a development. No such priests 
exist in familiar religion. 

We can carry the Abjad method, where used by organiza¬ 
tion, much further than isolated cases. In Sufi circles, in¬ 
stead of numerical substitution, rhyme or homonym is used 
to confuse the noninitiate as to the symbolism of ritual. 
Several mysterious societies in the West are offshoots of Sufi 
circles, and can easily be traced back through a knowledge 
of the Sufi organization, historical possibility, or the secret 
language. The Builders is one. Another is the Coalmen. 



THE COALMEN 


201 


In Arabic (and thence to Persian), the word FeHM, from 
the Semitic root FHM, means “to understand, perceive.” 
From it are derived the words “to make a person understand,” 
and so on. 

A Sufi circle called the fehmia (Perceivers) traces its phil¬ 
osophical pedigree to Bayazid of Bistam. There are two let¬ 
ters “h” in Arabic. A word using the second “h” is also pro¬ 
nounced like FeHM, but means Coalman, or charcoal 
dealer. 

Its members, to commemorate this in ritual, actually put 
charcoal on their faces. Freemasons are in some Arabic dic¬ 
tionaries called charcoal burners or Coalmen. 

An Italian secret society, originally devoted to doing good 
and to the ends of mutual protection, was called the Car¬ 
bonari, the charcoal burners. There can be no reasonable 
doubt, On historical, geographical and linguistic evidence, 
that this is a deteriorated form of the Perceivers. According 
to Sufi lore, when the dynamic element of a living teacher 
deserts a circle, it becomes repetitious and loses its interior 
quality. Whatever may be the truth of this, the Carbonari 
are an excellent example to study. 

The myth of the foundation of the Carbonari claims that 
King Francis I of France (died 1515) when out hunting 
strayed into Scotland, which bordered his territories. He was 
found and befriended by charcoal burners. These, however, 
were not ordinary people, but a band of mystics, who had 
been instructed by an ancient sage. Francis joined them 
and became their protector. If we realize that the country 
which bordered France was Spain, and not Scotland, and 
Sufiized Spain at that, 1 we begin to see another line of con¬ 
nection with the Sufi charcoal men. “Scotland” seems to be 
not a mistake, as has been thought, but a code name for 
Spain. This is borne out by the fact that the Freemasons 

1 The last great expulsion of Moslems from Spain was in 1609, 
when a million unrepentant Moors were deported. In Francis Fs time, 
nothing is more likely than fugitive associations of Sufis in the forests, 
instructed by “ancients.” 



202 THE SUEIS 

also state that early lodges were founded in “Scotland,” and 
they speak of “Scottish rites.” 

From being a mystical society, the Carbonari became 
ethical, then political. They were joined by many Free¬ 
masons. 2 There are many more points of resemblance be¬ 
tween the Sufi circle and the Italian. Engravings of Car- 
bonari meetings show the members ranged in the same way 
as in Sufi meetings. The smallest unit of the Carbonari 
was call ed the baracca, the “hut.” 

But among the Sufi Coalmen, baraka is a word for a meet¬ 
ing, originally a signal to call meetings. No less interesting 
is the fact that it was the reputation of the Sufi Coalmen 
that they could give a baraka (blessing) to brides in country 
districts. In England even today brides often call in the 
chimney sweep—with sooty face—to give them a kiss just 
after the wedding ceremony. EI-Aswad, the Black Man, is 
one of the important and mysterious figures in both North 
European and Spanish-Arab accounts of witchcraft rites 
(non-Catholic ceremonies) in many parts of Europe. 8 

Millions of words could be written on concealed Sufic 
meanings. Sometimes they are contained in phrases, some 
of them not very meaningful in their apparent sense, but 
repeated with a fervor which has baffled the uninitiated. 
Here is one such slogan. 

“Seek knowledge, even as far as China,” the phrase which 
is on all Sufi lips, has more than a literal or even a figurative 


2 Secret meanings in rituals and ideas diffused from Spain may thus 

be considered to remain “in suspension” or fossilized in many con¬ 
temporary systems, where the original meaning has been lost. It is 
interesting to note that even in Spain today, some of these meanings 
may be clearer to simple peasants than they are to the non-Arabist 
erudite of North Europe. Professor E. G. Browne, the celebrated 
Orientalist, reports a debased Arabic script as still in use for love let¬ 
ters by Spanish peasants in the early part of this century. 
(E. G. Browne, Literary History of Persia, Cambridge University 
Press, 1956, Vol. I, p. 9) . 

3 it is said that, under Louis XVTII and Charles X, over twelve 
thousand Freemasons in Paris were also Carbonari initiates. 



THE COALMEN 


203 

sense. This meaning is unlocked by analyzing the use of the 
word “China,” interpreted through the secret language. 

“China” is the code word for mind concentration, one of 
the Sufi practices, an essential prerequisite to Sufic develop¬ 
ment. The phrase is important partly because it provides an 
example of the coincidence in interpretation possible in 
either the Arabic or Persian languages. Neither has any real 
connection with the other. The fact that the word for 
“China” in both, though spelled and pronounced differently, 
decodes to substantially the same concept, invests this phrase 
with a special significance for the Sufi. 

This is the method of decoding: 

CHINA. In Arabic SYN (letters Saad, Ya, Nun). 
Equivalent numbers: 90, 10, 50. Totaled, these letters yield 
the number 150. Splitting by hundreds, tens and units: 
100 + 50 (no units remain). Retranslated into numbers: 
100 = Q, plus 50 = N. Q and N recombined to form a 
word: QN. The word QN (in the form QaNN) represents, 

| in Arabic, the concept of “scrutinizing, observing,” and is 
therefore taken as a symbol of concentration, focus. The in¬ 
junction now reads: “Seek knowledge, even as far as con¬ 
centration (of the mind).” 

CHINA. In Persian CHYN (letters Che, Ya, Nun). 
Equivalent numbers: 3, 10, 50. Before translating into num¬ 
bers, the Persian letter Che (CH) is first exchanged for its 
nearest equivalent in the Abjad scheme, which is J. The 
three sums totaled: 3 + 10 + 50 = 63. Separated into tens 
and units: 60 + 3. These numbers retranslated into letters: 
60 = SIN; 3 = JIM, The word we now have to determine is 
a combination of S and J. SJ (pronounced SaJJ) means “to 
plaster or coat, as with clay.” Reverse the order of the letters 
(a permissible change, one of very few allowed by the rules) 
and we have the word JS. The word is pronounced JaSS. 
This means “to inquire after a thing; to scrutinize (hidden 
things); to ascertain (news).” This is the root of the word 
for “espionage,” and hence the Sufi is called the Spy of the 
Heart. To the Sufi the scrutinization for the purpose of 



THE SUEIS 


204 

ascertaining hidden things is an equivalent, poetically speak¬ 
ing, with the motive for concentrating the mind. 

In their official documents, and in referring to one 
another, the Carbonari always used the term "good cousins.” 
This is an interesting example of translation from Arabic, 
and also of the transposing of Semitic roots, through allitera¬ 
tion, into another language—in this case Italian. "Good 
cousin” in Arabic is the same word which is used of the an¬ 
cient Sufis mentioned in the Koran, the muqaribin, the Near 
Ones, "close kindred.” The Semitic radical QRB from which 
the word is derived is cleverly perpetuated in the first syllable 
of the Italian word Carbonari, the K-R-B sound. There are 
many other resemblances of this kind in this and other 
usages of initiatory societies, most of which must remain 
concealed from outsiders, since they are still in use. 



The Secret Language 
II. The Builders 


Detach from fixed ideas and 
preconceptions. And face what is 
to be your lot. 

(Sheikh Abu-Said Ibn Abi-Khair) 


“Sufi-ism,” said Sir Richard Burton, was “the Eastern parent 
of Freemasonry .” 1 Whether Burton was a Freemason or not, 
there is no doubt that he was a Sufi. 

Freemasonry has been upheld by distinguished people in 
many countries, reviled and persecuted, linked with politics, 
reduced to the relative informality of staid businessmen's 
frolics, penetrated by Rosicrucianism, attacked as a Jewish 
imposture by the Nazis. It would not be seemly for a Free¬ 
mason to engage upon a public portrayal of any part of the 
craft's symbolism or beliefs—indeed it is more than probable 
that a member would be under an oath of secrecy whereby 
he must preserve every part of the brotherhood's workings 
from all who are not initiated. The source of material pur¬ 
porting to be Masonic for the nonmember, therefore, is 
bound to be fairly one-sided—the inner workings of 
Masonry provided by renegades and probably by opponents 
of the craft. 

When a study is made of all available literature purporting

206 THE SUFIS 

to contain Masonic secrets, certain definite outlines appear, 
which might justifiably be considered to form a reasonable 
amount of true information, on the no-smoke-without-fire 
principle. Be that as it may, what interests the Sufi is the 
fact that, out of the material which claims to be partially or 
wholly Masonic, a very great deal is at once seen to concur 
with matters of everyday Sufi initiatory practice. Either Free¬ 
masonry is, as Burton claimed, derived from the Sufis; or 
else the substance of the frequent and plentiful exposes, 
which may not be of Freemasonry at all, are in fact ex¬ 
posures of a Sufic cult other than Freemasonry. For the 
purposes of this study we shall approach this exciting part 
of the inquiry from the only perspective open to us. Parallels 
will be sought between what the exposers claim to be Free¬ 
masonry, and what we know of Sufic schools. 

One of the best methods of tracing Arab-Sufi transmis¬ 
sion to the West is through terminology. When a certain 
word is used with an esoteric significance, it is generally 
worthwhile studying it and seeking a parallel between the 
two systems. The fundamental word which we find most 
used in Masonic exposures is composed of the three Hebrew 
letters A, B, L. Transliterated into Arabic letters, this word 
proves to be the password of the Sufi society called the 
Builders (al-Banna); and the Arabic word for Mason is 
also al-Banna . Far from ending here, the parallels are only 
just beginning. 

As in the case of the troubadors (TRB, Arabic root), 
the Builders (first said to have flourished under this name 
in the ninth century) chose this triliteral word with care, 
searching the dictionary for a term which would embrace 
as many aspects of their ogamzation as possible. The re¬ 
sult, analyzed by inflecting the Arabic root in the normal 
manner, provides this list of characteristics of the schools 

ABL = monk, sexton, etc.; hierophancy 
ALB = to gather people together; grouping 
LaBA = to stop, to halt at a place 



THE BUILDERS 


207 


BaLA = to give a thing, to be beneficent 

BAL = heart, mind; attention; state; boldness; welfare 

Even without other information which exists about this 
Sufi school, we can already glean something of their organi¬ 
zation and objectives through this breakdown of their secret 
word* The first word intimates initiation, the second the 
congregation, the third the stages of the Path of the Sufis, 
the fourth the giving (of love and charity) which was their 
means of expression, the fifth various aspects of their activi¬ 
ties and training. Why was the word written in He¬ 
brew, and not in Arabic? Some late hand has reshaped the 
Arabic origins of the craft into a form more acceptable to 
people with a Judeo-Christian tradition; and we can safely 
assume from the published materials that it was to just such 
a community that the modem form of Masonry as we know 
it in the West was addressed. 

To the Sufi Builders, these three letters symbolized three 
meditation postures. The Kufic letter alif was the kneeling 
position. Dhul-Nun Misri, one of the greatest Sufi teachers, 
is believed to have formulated it in this shape. It became 
powerful in Turkey during the sixteenth century. Western 
writers say “it is strangely like the Masons.” It was illus¬ 
trated by a set square, a primal symbol of the Masons. In 
Arabic, again, the word square is RBA—which summarizes 
meditation very well in its alternative meaning of “waiting, 
restraint” The second letter, ba, is written in Arabic letters 
like a boat with a dot under it This forms a fairly passable 
diagram of its symbol—the level—also used in Masonry. This 
conveys the emblematic meaning of “prostration and con¬ 
centration.” The final letter, lam, is likened to a rope. In 
shape it is very much like a hook or curving piece of rope. 
It means to the Builder “the rope which binds all in union.” 

There are, according to the Sufis, ninety-nine divine 
names or attributes. The development of the effect of all 
these names produces the complete individual. The hun¬ 
dredth name is a secret, and becomes known to the Seeker 



THE SUEIS 


208 

only when he has become imbued with the spirit of the 
others. The number thirty-three is used by the Builders to 
denote one third of the total training system which produces 
the first grade of enlightenment. In the numerical system 
of the Arabic alphabet (where every letter has a number) 
thirty-three provides: 30 = letter L; 3 = letter J, This is 
the only way in which the number can be split up by this 
system. If the letters L and J are then considered to spell a 
word, they constitute the password or initiatory meaning of 
the first third of Sufi enlightenment Is there a word LJ or 
JL in Arabic? Indeed there is. There are both. LJ spells 
“flame,” and Sufistically stands for the illumination, the 
burning desire of love. JL spells “illustrious.” The flaming 
sword which is reputedly a Masonic emblem is used by 
the Builders to correspond with this meaning—the thirty- 
three names. 

What of the hundredth name? This, strange though it 
may seem, seems to be the (now corrupted) original of the 
strange G-like symbol found within the Masonic star in 
items of regalia. In the cult of the Builders, this G is the 
Arabic letter Q, which it closely resembles. 2 And Q stands 
for the secret, the final element. In the same Arabic letter- 
number notation, Q is equivalent to the number one 
hundred. 

This method of codes within codes, and using letters and 
numbers to convey matters which only the initiated under¬ 
stand is characteristic of dervish poets; and since it occurs 
in too many particulars for it to be mere coincidence, the 
Masonic usage and the Sufi one are identical. Take the mat¬ 
ter a stage further. If we add the letter Q, the hidden 
power, to the three-letter word ALB, eliding the letter A, in 
Arabic we have a further panorama of hidden meanings: 

Q-ABL = beforehand, first, prior (primacy of the cult) 

2 In Colloquial Arabic, the Q sound may be rendered, especially 
by non-Arabs, as G. The tendency is more marked still in some coun¬ 
tries which use Arabic words, but themselves lack the guttural Q 
sound. 



THE BUILDERS 209 

Q-ALB = heart CSufi symbol for contemplation and in¬ 
ner metaphysical contact) 3 

L-aQB = title, honorific (the distinction of the cult) 

And, whether by accident or design, the three letters 
Q,L,B, when added together according to the Arabic nota¬ 
tion, produce 132. This can be read as 32 + 1 = 33. But, 
according to the Builders, it is an intimation of the secret 
teaching passed on with great secrecy by one whose name, 
when calculated by the same method in Arabic, provides 
the number thirty-three. And this is how they spell it: 


M 

= 

40 

H 

= 

8 

M 

= 

40 

M 

= 

40 

D 

= 

4 


The word, spelled according to Arab orthography, is 
Mohammed. We are now at the stage when the Builders 
reveal that the Sufic lore which they practice was a part 
of the secret teaching of Mohammed himself. 

This figure of thirty-three, or the letter Q, the Sufi Build¬ 
ers inscribe within a pentagram, and sometimes in a star 
composed of two triangles. In other esoteric traditions, these 
superimposed triangles are explained as standing for male 
and female principles, as air and fire, and so on. But to the 
Sufi Builder, the lower triangle is the shaped Arabic nu¬ 
meral seven. The upper one is the outline of the number 
eight. And, taken together, the six sides of the two triangles 
comprise the number six. This, to them, means the series 
786. And 786 is the religious formula Bismillah ar-Rahman, 
ar-Rahim, reduced to figures by direct substitution. The 
meaning of the phrase is the same as that found on a Sufic 
crucifix from ninth-century Ireland—In the name of Allah, 
the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

The Kaaba (cubical temple) of Mecca was rebuilt in 

3 See annotation “QALB.”

THE SUFIS 


608 A.D., when Mohammed was thirty-five years old, and 
five years before he started his teaching. This temple was 
built with thirty-one courses of stone and wood. 4 The Sufis 
add: "with Earth and Sky, thirty-three." 

It would be improper to go any further in presenting 
material which both Freemasons and organized dervish 
fraternities possess and consider to be of high initiatory 
significance. 5 But there are incidental facts which can be 
mentioned, and are of some general interest. Freemasonry, 
according to some of its historians, came to England in the 
time of Aethelstan (about 894-939), the Saxon king who 
brought England into close contact with the rest of Europe. 
His life covered almost the same period as that of the il¬ 
lustrious Spanish Sufi Ibn Masarra (883-931) from whose 
illuminist school a tremendous and continuing influence 
upon Western thought has been traced. It was during the 
same century that Dhu’l-Nun the Egyptian, the Sufi and 
reputed founder of the dervish Order of Builders, lived 
and taught. Dhu’l-Nun, revered by all Sufis, is referred to 
as having been of Nubian ("black”) origin, giving a con¬ 
nection with the adoption of "black” Qfehm) and “knowl¬ 
edge, understanding” Qfehm) by the dervish school of the 
Coalmen, which we associate with the Carbonari . 

“Black” is also another word for Egypt, said to be derived 
from the color of the soil. The Black Art is thought by many 
to mean nothing more than “the Egyptian Art,” or the “Art 
of Understanding.” By a similar process of thought, the 
Black Virgins of the middle ages could be translated as the 
“Wise Virgins.” The confusion between the Black Art, the 
Hermetic Art and the Egyptian Secrets has appeared and 
reappeared throughout medieval literature. The misunder¬ 
standing exists only because of ignorance of the similarity of 
“black” and “wise” in Arabic by foreigners.

THE BUILDERS

The connection between Black Art, alchemy and Rosi- 
crudanism has baffled many students, who have assumed 
for the most part that all these things, were dabbled in by 
Europeans of the middle ages just because of a general 
credulity and desire to penetrate secrets and find a hidden 
teaching. 

The connection beween the Shriners and the Masons has 
seemed to many observers to be absurd, or some sort of a 
false assodation. A Shriner must be a Mason. His ritual is 
avowedly based upon a myth and ritual connected with the 
Holy Temple in Mecca. What possible connection, it is 
sometimes asked, could there be between the Mecca temple 
of the Moslems and the Temple of Solomon and its build¬ 
ing? There could be a very close connection indeed. First 
let it be noted that charges against andent Sufis included 
the terrible allegation that a mime of the Mecca pilgrimage 
ceremonies could be carried out anywhere with equal 
validity to an actual pilgrimage. Secondly, let us remember 
that the great Sufi teacher Maaruf Karkhi (died 815) is 
known as Son of David, and also as “king” a common 
Sufi appellation. The Son of David, by assodation, was 
Solomon. Solomon it was who rebuilt the Temple. Why 
Son of David? Because Karkhi was the disdple of the illus¬ 
trious teacher Daud el Tai. Daud is Arabic for David. 

This David died in 781. Less than a century before, 
about 691, the Saracens rebuilt the Temple of Solomon on 
the site which is now known as the Dome of the Rock. This, 
and no earlier one, is the Temple whose servants were the 
Knights Templars, accused of Saracenic leanings. It is 
no acddent that after the dissolution of the Order of the 
Templars the Freemasons took on Templar traditions. 

It should not be forgotten that the Kaaba (literally, the 
Cube) is the foursquare temple of Mecca. The “black stone” 
of Mecca is set in an outer comer of the Kaaba. It is thus 
correctly described as the Kaaba (Cube) stone, easily ren¬ 
dered as the Cubic Stone. It is also called hajarel aswad 
(black stone). “Black,” as we have noted, is rendered as 



THE SUEIS 


212 

"coal,” and the "stone of black” can be rendered as hajarel 
fehm, "stone of wisdom,” or even, in translation, "stone of 
the wise.” Second only to this place for all Moslems is the 
sanctified spot known as the Temple of Solomon in 
Palestine. 

Sufi tradition has it that a band of early classical Sufis 
were a number of men who assembled in the Mecca temple 
and devoted themselves to its service. On the fall of Jeru¬ 
salem to the Arabs, the first act of the Moslems was to re¬ 
pair to the site of the Solomonic Temple to acquire it for 
Islam. That the Sufi tradition was continued in respect of 
the Dome of the Rock is evidenced by the fact that its later 
interior decorations contain Sufi symbolic designs. Templar 
churches and other indications show the influence of the 
Saracen version of the Solomonic Temple. 

There axe two lines of diffusion of this lore to the West 
—initially through Saracen Spain, with or without Jewish 
amalgamation of ideas (because Jews were active in co¬ 
operation with the Arab Cabalists), and again through the 
Crusades, when members of the cult known as the Builders 
may very well have found similar rituals among the der¬ 
vishes of the Near East 

Finally, the darkness-and-light motif attributed to Free¬ 
masonry has dervish parallels so close that these alone 
would give one cause to wonder. The dervishes speak of 
light as truth, illumination. Black, as we have already noted, 
is associated with wisdom (being homonymous with it in 
Arabic); and white, too, stands for understanding. Know¬ 
ing the true meaning of wisdom and light, of good and bad, 
of the real "darkness” of the ignorant is the central point in 
dervish activity. Sufis ultimately in this connection depend 
upon the light Verse in the Koran (Sura 24, 35), which 
says: "Rejectors* deeds are like darkness: darkness upon 
darkness. No light at all has he who has not Allah's light” 
This theme is taken up in careful detail by Ghazali, whom 
we know influenced all the scholastic West. He wrote a 



THE BUILDERS 213 

book on the subject o£ light and darkness—the Niche for 
Lights. 

The dervish usage of the light and darkness theme carries 
on through the literature* A fair sample is in the Secret 
Garden of Shabistari, composed in 1319: “The dervish path 
is dark in both worlds; yet it is but the gloom that on the 
horizon of the desert gladdens the wayfarer and tells the 
tents are near at hand. . . • Within a day of darkness 
shineth light.” 

Johnson Pashas translation (The Dialogue of the Gul- 
shan-i-Raz, Cairo, 1903), whether from Masonic or Builder 
sources, is not unknown in English literature. Pope, for 
instance (Dunciad, Bk. IV), could have been using a Sufi 
allegory when he wrote: 

Of darkness visible, so much be lent. 

As half to show, half veil, the deep intent. 

From our knowledge of dervish usage, we can interpret 
the mysterious message in a curious and repeated Masons 
mark which appears in medieval buildings. This is a mark 
which looks like the figure four. If the professional Masons 
of the middle ages were connected with dervish orders in 
the West, as the Eastern building workers certainly were, 
we have a concealed message here. 

The Sufi diagram known as the Magic Square of fifteen 
is drawn thus:

This square adds up to the number fifteen, whichever 
way the lines of figures (one to nine) are added up. It is 
used in Cabalism as a code frame by means of which to 







THE SOTIS 


214 

convey a message. This is done by drawing lines to link 
up the numbers which it is intended to emphasize. The 
Mason's mark which we are considering looks something 
like this; 



If this figure is superimposed upon the frame, we can 
read off which numbers have been involved in the message. 
The outline crosses all the squares of the figure, except the 
one occupied by the number eight! 



Eght symbolizes the number of perfect expression, the 
octagon, representing, among other things, the cube. The 
figure also covers eight of a total of nine squares. The mean¬ 
ing here is “The eight (balance) the way to the nine." 
Nine stands in Arabic for the letter T a, whose hidden 
meaning is “secret knowledge." 

The outline is given additional significance when it is 
realized that the figure which looks like a four with a bar 
(sometimes a curve) attached is also a rough representation 
of the Arabic word hoo —the dervish liturgical word, 
chanted in order to produce ecstatic states. 

That the Masons are connected with alchemy through 
this sign alone is made more likely by the fact that this 
magic square has been found in use in China and com- 




THE BUILDERS

mented upon by recent alchemical researchers, who there 
link it with both alchemy of the symbolic land and the 
Taoist tradition. If further indications were needed, one 
could refer to the fact that this same magic square is used 
by Geber, the patron of both Eastern and Western alchemy, 
and (as Professor Holmyard remarks) used also by the Sufi 
society of which Geber was a member. 

Far from an irregular and haphazard collecting of mys¬ 
terious and unconnected lore, the alchemists, Freemasons, 
Rosicrucians, Carbonari and others were almost certainly 
intermingled, because of Sufic symbolic constituents in their 
original or early objective—the development of human con¬ 
sciousness. 


The Secret Language 
III. The Philosopher’s Stone 


Deep in the sea are riches beyond compare* 
But if you seek safety, it is on the shore. 

(Saadi, Rose Garden ) 


Robert of Chester, an Englishman who studied in Saracen 
Spain, introduced alchemy to Christendom of the mid¬ 
dle ages in a book which he finished in 1144. This was a 
translation of an Arabic book, and in it, as Professor Holm- 
yard notes ( Alchemy , London, 1957, p. 103), he states 
categorically that this science was not at that time known 
in the “Latin world.” 

Ever since this time there has been a struggle between 
the two interpretations of the “Art” Was it intended literally, 
or was alchemy a spiritual or mental developmental system? 
Almost inevitably, the fact that it was tackled both in the 
chemical and initiatory manner has been missed by many 
researchers. The consequence has been that some claim that 
alchemy was the forerunner of chemistry, exclusively con¬ 
cerned with producing the Philosopher’s Stone; others that 
it stems from early attempts to gild or plate metals and pass 
them off as gold or silver; others that it is a sublime art 
which deals only with the potentialities of the human con¬ 
sciousness. 



THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE 217 

The facts are far less complicated than they have ap¬ 
peared to those who have not linked Sufi allegory with what 
is often only derivative literature. The first thing to re¬ 
member is that the people who are indiscriminately lumped 
together as alchemists, and whose work has so often been 
treated as a whole, in actual fact constitute several different 
kinds of people, working along different or analogous lines. 

Goldsmiths' recipes, originating at an early date, are no 
proof that alchemical terminology was not used by mystics. 
Two people, each supposed to have attained the elixir, may 
very well be in the one instance a charlatan, in the other a 
mystical teacher. Abundant evidence in the literature of 
the middle ages points to a constant struggle toward a form 
of mental development, couched in alchemical terminology. 

The mistake was not rectified when the French chemist 
M. P. E. Berthelot, in 1888 and 1893, examined a wide 
variety of alchemical documents. A thorough worker, he 
found that the earliest available were under two thousand 
years old. Further, he found books containing metallurgical 
recipes for working and tinting metals—manuals of crafts¬ 
men in which the texts were mixed with a certain amount 
of spirituality. It was concluded, before most of the readers 
of this book were born, that alchemy was a sort of aberra¬ 
tion, a degeneration of metallurgy and very early chemistry 
carried out by Greeks in Egypt. 

The material was not examined in the light of the idea 
that alchemy was the terminology adopted by a teaching 
school for the projection of its allegorized message, which 
originated completely outside the metallic context. 

The literature of alchemy, lumped together as one phe¬ 
nomenon, is so immense that lifetimes have been spent in 
an attempt to understand it. It includes forgeries of greater 
or lesser plausibility in Greek, Latin, Arabic and later West¬ 
ern languages. These writings are sometimes incoherent, 
veiled in symbolism and shot through with allegory and 
such bizarre imagery as dragons, changing colors, blazing 
swords, metals and planets. 


THE SUFIS 


2 l8 

The assumption that the quest of transmutation is an 
enterprise arising out of a misunderstanding of artisans' 
documents is quite insufficient to explain the consistent use 
of terminology by the alchemists. If we read the Arabic 
words for which Latin equivalents were chosen by trans¬ 
lators, we can judge whether the Latins were trying real 
metallic transmutation or something else, from their use of 
these terms. In other words, we can tell the chemists from 
the spiritualists. This is one of the tools which unlocks the 
story of medieval alchemy. 

We have to start at an early stage, with the father of 
alchemy as we know it, Jabir Ibn el-Hayyan. Jabir has been 
acknowledged by both the Arab and the European alche¬ 
mists as the patron of the art since the eighth century. All 
alchemy as such known to us since that time contains the 
doctrine of three elements—salt, sulphur and mercury. 
These must be correctly combined to produce the Philosoph¬ 
ical Gold. It is stressed by many alchemists, one might al¬ 
most say all of them, that these substances are not the same 
as those which we know as salt, sulphur and mercury. 
Further, Geber, as Jabir was known in the West, is recorded 
by Professor Holmyard as having introduced the sulphur 
and mercury doctrine which “appears to have been un¬ 
known to the ancients.” 

Alchemy as it has been practiced since the eighth century 
bears the stamp of Jabir Ibn el-Hayyan. Who was he, and 
what did he mean by his sulphur and mercury? According 
to the Latin as well as Arabic books, Jabir was sumamed 
El-Sufi, the Sufi. 1 

He acknowledges in his works the Imam Jafar Sadiq 
(700-765) as his master, and speaks of him in the most 
respectful terms. And Jafar Sadiq is the great Sufi teacher 
whose name appears on almost all the “chains of transmis¬ 
sion” of the lore of Sufism, which is itself called alchemy 
by such authorities as Rumi and Ghazali. Ghazali even 

1 Alchemy was called the Sophie Ait in the middle ages. 



THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE 219 

names one of his most important books The Alchemy of 
Happiness, Ibn El-Arabi says that the “Great Names” are 
called gold and silver. 

What is the Sophistical Stone, the Stone of the Philoso¬ 
phers, as it is called, which would transmute base metals 
into precious ones? All we have to do here is to retranslate 
certain words into Arabic, and see what their technical 
usage is among the Sufis, and we find what Jabir was talking 
about. 

The regeneration of an essential part of humanity, ac¬ 
cording to the Sufis, is the goal of mankind. The separation 
of man from his essence is the cause of his disharmony and 
unfulfillment. His quest is the purification of the dross and 
the activation of the gold. The means of achieving this is 
found within man—it is the Philosophers Stone. The 
Arabic word for stone is associated with the word for “hid¬ 
den, forbidden.” Hence the stone symbol was adopted in 
accordance with the normal rule of assonance in use among 
Sufis. 

The stone, the hidden thing, so powerful, is also called 
the Azoth in the West. Azoth is traced by Orientalists to 
one of two words— el-dhat (or ez-zat), meaning essence 
or inner reality; or else to zibaq , mercury. The stone, ac¬ 
cording to the Sufis, is the dhat, the essence, which is so 
powerful that it can transform whatever comes into con¬ 
tact with it. It is the essence of man, which partakes of 
what people call the divine. It is “sunshine,” capable of up¬ 
lifting humanity to a next stage. 

We can go much further than this. Three elements went 
toward the production of the dhat, after being submitted to 
the “work,” which is a translation of the word amal. These 
elements are sulphur ( kihrit , homonym of kibirat, “great¬ 
ness, nobility”); salt (milh, homonym of milh, “goodness, 
learning”); and mercury ( [zibaq, sharing the radix for “to 
open a lock, to break”). 2 

2 Paracelsus (1493-1541) notes: "Mercury is the spirit, sulphur is 
the soul, salt is the body.” 


THE SUFIS 


220 

Unless we know how the words were used and also what 
they are equivalents for, we cannot unlock alchemy, Ibn 
El-Arabi himself reveals two of the meanings when he says 
that sulphur stands for the divine; mercury for nature. The 
interaction in correct proportion produced the Azoth, the 
ennobled essence. Translation into Latin lost the assonance 
which the Sufi works had, but their interpretation con¬ 
tinued (for the benefit of non-Arabs) in the books in Per¬ 
sian, like Ghazali's Alchemy of Happiness . 

The transmission of the lore of alchemy is also stated to 
have been in the hands of ancient masters, some of whom 
are named. These include Hermes, according to the Eastern 
and Western writers, known to the Arabs as Idris. Western 
authors and practitioners accept the transmission from 
Hermes to such an extent that alchemy is often called by 
them the Hermetic Art, and has been so styled ever since 
they accepted this origin from the Arabs. 

The Spanish-Arab historian Said of Toledo (died 1069) 
gives this tradition of Thoth, or Hermes: “Sages affirm that 
all antediluvian sciences originate with the first Hermes, 
who lived in Sa’id, in Upper Egypt. The Jews call him 
Enoch and the Moslems Idris. He was the first who spoke 
of the material of the superior world and of planetary move¬ 
ments. He built temples to worship God . . . medicine and 
poetry were his functions. . . . [He] warned of a catastro¬ 
phe of fire and water before the Flood. . . . After the 
Flood the sciences, including alchemy and magic, were 
carried out at Memphis, under the more renowned Hermes 
the Second.” 3 

The Thrice-Great Hermes, who quite possibly did repre¬ 
sent three different teachers, is not only the reputed origina¬ 
tor of alchemy. His name appears among the ancient mas¬ 
ters of what is now called the Way of the Sufis. In other 
words, both the Sufis and the alchemists claim Hermes as 
an initiate of their craft. So Jafar Sadiq the Sufi, Jabir the 

8 Cf. Asm Palacios, Ibn Masana, p. 13. 



221 


THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE 

Sufi and Hermes the reputed Sufi are all credited by al¬ 
chemists of both East and West as being masters of their 
craft 

The methods of concentration, distillation, maturing and 
mixing, endowed with chemical names, is nothing other 
than an organization of the mind and body to produce a 
human, not a chemical effect That there were imitators 
who practiced physical chemistry is in no doubt whatever. 
But it is equally true to say that there were until fairly 
recently (and they still linger in some places) people who 
believed that spiritual things had a physical parallel. 

Who was Jafar Sadiq, master of Jabir, and his teacher? 
None other than the Sixth Imam, or Leader, descendant 
of Mohammed through Fatima, believed by many to be of the 
direct line which transmitted the inner teaching of Islam, 
confided to them by Mohammed himself, called Sufism. 

Jabir Ibn el-Hayyan was for a long time a close compan¬ 
ion of the Barmecides, the viziers of Haroun el-Rashid. 
These barmakis were descended from the priests of the 
Afghan Buddhist shrines, and were held to have at their 
disposal the ancient teaching which had been transmitted 
to them from that area. Haroun el-Rashid himself was a 
constant associate of Sufis, and there are instances on record 
of his mating reverential pilgrimages to meet Sufi masters. 

The assumption that alchemical lore came from Egypt 
direct from the writings of Thoth, or something of that 
kind, is unnecessary to this thesis. According to Sufi tradi¬ 
tion the lore was transmitted through Dhu’l-Nun the 
Egyptian, the King or Lord of the Fish, one of the most 
famous of classical Sufi teachers. 

Who was Hermes, or how was he generally conceived of? 

He was the god who carried the souls of the dead to the 
underworld, and carried messages from the gods. He was 
the link between the extrahuman and the terrestrial. He 
moved, like Mercury, his equivalent, at immense speed, 
negating time and space, just in the way that inner experi¬ 
ence does. He is an athlete, a developed man, and is con- 



222 


THE SUFIS 


sidered therefore to resemble the “perfected man” of the 
Sufi in his outward aspect In his earlier statues, he is shown 
as a matured man, a man of age and wisdom, thought of as 
correct results of right development He invented the lyre 
and caused, as Sufis and others do, an altered state in the 
hearers by means of music. He cast a giant into a sle$p with 
his flute, which action was taken as an indication of the 
hypnotic character of the personification of Hermes as a 
Sufic type. The connection with this hypnotic activity and 
both mysticism and medicine is obvious. 

The ancient lore and its preservation and transmission is 
well anchored to this Hermes figure. He has a female 
double—Sesheta—associated with the building of temples, 
and the keeper of books in which ancient wisdom was pre¬ 
served. Like the aspiring human being of the Sufis and also 
the Sufi Truth ( simurgh ), he is represented as a bird. Some¬ 
times he is a man with the head of an ibis, where the head 
would indicate aspiration or attainment in the mind, local¬ 
ized in the head. 

The world was created through a word from Thoth— 
eight characteristics (four symbolized as gods, four as god¬ 
desses) were made from a sound which he uttered. The 
eightfold character of Sufi teaching is symbolized by the 
octagonal diagram for the word hoo, the Sufi sound. 

Whatever other deities or legends may have become con¬ 
fused with the personalities of Hermes, Mercury and 
Thoth, the main elements of intermediation between hu¬ 
man and divine, wisdom, music, letters and medicine, 
remain. 

In the threefold figure—Egyptian, Greek and Roman- 
like has been equated with like. His association with a form 
of wisdom which was transmitted to man from divine 
sources remains. It is undoubtedly far more comprehensive 
than the alchemical format which was later given to it 

For centuries people were baffled by the reputed teaching 
of Thrice-Great Hermes, inscribed on an Emerald Tablet, 
which the Arabs communicated as the great inner principle 



THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE 223 

of the Great Work. This was the ultimate authority of the 
alchemists, and may be rendered thus: 

The truth, certainty, truest, without untruth. What is 
above is like what is below. What is below is like what 
is above. The miracle of unity is to be attained. Every¬ 
thing is formed from the contemplation of unity, and 
all things come about from unity, by means of adapta¬ 
tion. Its parents are the Sun and the Moon. It was 
borne by the wind and nurtured by the Earth. Every 
wonder is from it, and its power is complete. Throw 
it upon earth, and earth will separate from fire. The 
impalpable separated from the palpable. Through wis¬ 
dom it rises slowly from the world to heaven. Then it 
descends to the world, combining the power of the up¬ 
per and the lower. Thus you shall have the illumina¬ 
tion of all the world, and darkness will disappear. 
This is the power of all strength—it overcomes that 
which is delicate and penetrates through solids. This 
was the means of the creation of the world. And in the 
future wonderful developments will be made, and this 
is the way. 

I am Hermes the Threefold Sage, so named because 
I hold the three elements of all the wisdom. And thus 
ends the revelation of the work of Sun. 

This is the same as the Sufi dictum (Introduction to the 
Perception of Jafar Sadiq): “Man is the microcosm, crea¬ 
tion the macrocosm—the unity. All comes from One. By 
the joining of the power of contemplation all can be at¬ 
tained. This essence must be separated from the body first, 
then combined with the body. This is the Work. Start with 
yourself, end with all. Before man, beyond man, transfor¬ 
mation.” 

If it can be established that there was such a thing as 
metallurgical lore which resembled alchemy, and also that 
there was spiritual alchemy without chemical experimenta¬ 
tion, there is still another point missed by commentators. 


THE SUEIS 


224 

Jabir (or his followers, at least some of them Sufis) actually 
did carry out chemical research. They made discoveries 
which are acknowledgedly the basis of modem chemistry. 
To the modem mind, this means that they were trying for 
the Philosophers Stone—were attempting actual metallic 
transmutation. Could they have gone through the years of 
experiment and endured with patience the reverses which 
all alchemists encountered, unless they were convinced that 
there was a theoretical possibility of success? Would they 
have carried out such serious experiments merely as a blind, 
in societies which frowned upon individual religious activ¬ 
ity, creating a facade so complete that they actually had 
to attempt transmutation? 

Two flaws in current thought prevent the real facts from 
being understood. The first is that people tend to judge the 
people of the past by themselves. The second is the usual 
difficulty which faces the external theorist—he has not been 
inside the doors of a Sufi school. The Sufis have a tradition 
which has been maintained for many centuries. This can 
be summarized in the term “undertaking.” A Sufic under¬ 
taking may not seem scientific by contemporary standards, 
but it is nevertheless widely applied. The Seeker is given 
an enterprise to complete. It may be an alchemical problem, 
or it may be the effort to reach the conclusion of an enter¬ 
prise just as unlikely of attainment. For the purposes of his 
self-development he has to carry that undertaking out with 
complete faith. In the process of planning and carrying 
through this effort, he attains his spiritual development. 
The alchemical or other undertaking may be impossible, but 
it is the framework within which his constancy and his 
application, his mental and moral development, is carried 
out. To this extent it is secondary. Insofar as it is perma¬ 
nent for him and for his lifetime, perhaps, it is not second¬ 
ary at all, because it becomes his permanent anchor and 
frame of reference. It is in something slightly like this spirit 
that all competitive undertakings are carried out in sport, or 
mountaineering, or even in physical culture, in other so- 



THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE 225 

cieties. The mountain or the muscular development are the 
fixed points, but they are not the element which is actually 
being transformed by the effort. They are the means, not 
the end. The whole concept may seem strange, but it is 
ultimately based upon its own logic. It is not the framework 
which is altered by the effort, but the human being him¬ 
self. And it is the development of the human being which 
counts, nothing else. 

When the Sufic concept of the deliberate evolution of 
humanity is grasped, the other elements fall into place. In 
a similar spirit, perhaps, Latin is taught in some schools 
to develop a part of the mind. An externalist or literal ob¬ 
server might say that the study of Latin is one of the least 
useful of occupations. All depends upon his use of the word 
"useful." I recently heard a man refer to a cigarette smoker 
as “a mechanism for the consumption of tobacco." So he is, 
but only from one point of view—just as an automobile 
might be looked upon as a means of burning gasoline. Its 
other functions have been overlooked in this statement, 
which nevertheless may be said to remain true within a 
narrow context. 

There is a Sufi allegory about alchemy, which is interest¬ 
ing because of its connection with Western thought. A 
father has several idle sons. On his deathbed he tells them 
that they will find his treasure hidden in his field. They dig 
up the field and find nothing. So they plant wheat, which 
provides an abundant crop. For several years they do this. 
They find no gold, but indirectly they become both en¬ 
riched and accustomed to constructive labor. Ultimately 
they become honest farmers, and forget the digging for gold. 

The search for gold through chemical methods, then, 
produces gains which are other than those apparently 
sought. This story was certainly known in the West, be¬ 
cause it is actually quoted both by Bacon and by Boerhaave, 
the seventeenth-century chemist, who stresses the impor¬ 
tance of the work rather than the supposed objective. In 
his De Augumentis Scientiarum, Bacon says: “Alchemy is 



THE SUEIS 


226 

like the man who told his sons that he had buried gold for 
them in his vineyards. They dug and found no gold, but 
this turned the mold for the vine roots and caused an abun¬ 
dant harvest” 

The thirteenth-century Speculum Alchemiae, attributed 
to Bacon, gives a hint of the evolutionary theory of alchemy: 
“I must tell you that Nature always intends and strives to 
the perfection of Gold: but many accidents, coming be¬ 
tween, change the metals.” 

Numerous Sufi commentators of Rumi's evolutionary 
poems (“Man first of all appeared in the mineral domain”) 
say, “The human metal must be refined and expanded.” 

The function of the Philosopher's Stone as a universal 
medicine and a source of longevity shows another aspect of 
spiritual alchemy which dovetails exactly with the Sufi pro¬ 
cedures,, The interesting fact here is that in Sufi tradition 
the stone or elixir is a state of mind, concentrated by the 
doctor within himself and transmitted to the patient by 
means of his mind. If some of the Western accounts of 
reviving sick patients with the stone are read in this assump¬ 
tion, we can see what the stone was. After the mind is con¬ 
centrated and transformed in a certain way (salt, mercury 
and sulphur combined), the result is the stone—certain 
power. This stone is now projected upon the patient, who 
recovers. 

The secret (because concealed within the mind) stone 
(force) is the source and essence of life itself. 

Recent historical research has unearthed the fact that 
alchemy, using similar ideas and symbolism, was practiced 
in China as early as the fifth century B.C. Chinese and 
Japanese and Western scholars claim that the development 
of alchemy in China was originally spiritual, and that it 
was only later that the metallurgical aspect arose. It is pos¬ 
sible that the metalworkers adopted the theme from the 
Taoist divines, and not the other way about, as immediate 
assumption would tend to believe. Many, if not all, of the 
ideas of alchemy as a spiritual process are present in the 



THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE X2TJ 

teachings of the Chinese sage Lao Tzu, the founder of 
Taoism, who was probably born in 604 B.C. 

We also find the elixir theory, of a preparation or method 
which confers immortality, in the philosophers of China 
connected with alchemy, and in the Hindu Atharva Veda, 
whose date is earlier than 1000 B.C. Chinese philosophers 
specifically state that there are three alchemies, as Professor 
Read notes. The first is to produce longevity through liquid 
gold; the second is to produce a red sulphurous ingredient 
in goldmaking; the third was to transmute other metals into 
gold. 4 

Dr. O. S. Johnson, in A Study of Chinese Alchemy, 
which he completed at the University of California, details 
some remarkable material which he has extracted from 
Chinese sources on the antiquity of this art and its equation 
with the search for immortality through human efforts of 
self-development. 

The Chinese alchemist Lu Tsu (quoted by William A. P. 
Martin, The Lore of Cathay, 1901, p. 59) gives what some 
writers have thought a deliberately baffling "chemical proc¬ 
ess” for transmutation. In the light of what has already 
been said it can be read straight through as a reference to 
the potential development of the essence of man. It is only 
baffling if one is trying to find laboratory instructions: "I 
must diligently plant my own field. There is within it a 
spiritual germ that may live a thousand years. Its flower is 
like yellow gold. Its bud is not large, but its seeds are round 
and like unto a spotless gem. Its growth depends upon the 
soil of the central palace, but its irrigation must proceed 
from a higher fountain. After nine years of cultivation, root 
and branch may be transplanted to the heaven of the higher 
genii.” 

Translated into Sufi terms this would read: "Man must 
develop by his own effort, toward growth of an evolutionary 
nature, stabilizing his consciousness. He has within him an

essence, initially tiny, shining, precious. Development de¬ 
pends upon man, but must start through a teacher. When 
the mind is cultivated correctly and suitably, the conscious¬ 
ness is translated to a sublime plane.” 

For those who are interested in such things as chronology, 
the foregoing seems to be an indication that, as the Sufis 
say, their lore is timeless and reaches back to the most re¬ 
mote antiquity. In the hymns of the Aryans assigned to 
about 2000 B.C. there are indications of a formulation of 
doctrines which have come to be considered Sufic in the 
sense of the carrying out of certain practices of sublimation 
and development. The engendering of metals is also men¬ 
tioned here. 

That the alchemists of the West knew that they were 
pursuing an internal goal is clear from their admonitions 
and the innumerable cryptic illustrations in their works. 
Alchemical allegory is by no means difficult to read if one 
bears in mind Sufi symbolism. In the seventeenth century, 
a thousand years after the time of their original inspixer, 
Geber (bom circa 721), the European alchemists were 
keeping lists of successive masters, reminiscent of the Sufi 
"spiritual pedigrees.” One of the most interesting things 
about this fact is that these chains of succession refer to 
people who are linked in the Sufic and Saracen tradition, 
but otherwise have no common denominator. In the records, 
we find the name of Mohammed, Geber, Hermes, Dante 
and Roger Bacon. 

Recent research has shown that Sufi materials were 
sources of Dante’s illuminist work, such as the Divine 
Comedy . His Sufic affiliations must, however, have been 
known to the alchemists all the time. Raymond Lully, the 
Majorcan mystic, is again and again cited as an alchemical 
Adept Yet from his works we learn that his exercises were 
actually taken from the Sufis, whom he names as such. 

The Arab and Jewish illuminist Sufis invoke the succes¬ 
sion as Hermes (symbolizing the most ancient wisdom, of 
celestial origin), Mohammed (and some members of his

family and companions), Jabir or one of his associates, and 
thence to the modern orders. The Latin Western alchemists 
trace their lore from Hermes to Geber, thence through the 
illuminists. Bacon was one, Lully another, as well as various 
other Western practitioners. 

The Sufi concept of gaining unity from diversity, integrat¬ 
ing the mind and then the inner consciousness, through 
the appearance of a master who shall provide the key, 5 
through the proper application of the homonyms for salt, 
sulphur and mercury—to reach the “light,” according to the 
illuminists—is found in alchemical doctrine again and 
again. 

Only its concealment in chemical phraseology prevents 
its being attacked as private-enterprise human progress, out¬ 
side the Church. Here is a typical example, the caption to 
an alchemical diagram symbolizing the Work, in the Virir

The Whole Work of Philosophy. Those which were 
formerly enclosed in many forms are now seen in one. 
The start is the Master [“elder,” literally] and he brings 
the Key. Sulphur with Salt and Mercury will give

That this cryptic utterance was symbolic and should be 
applied to the secret teaching of self-perfection and human 
alchemicalization is stressed as far as the author dares in the 
final sentence, warning in effect against physical alchemy: 

If you see nothing here, you will not be able to seek 
further. You will be blind, even though you are in the

relying upon ancient lore alone. It was constantly renewed 
from the te achin gs of people who had been in contact with 
Sufi study. This is evidenced by the constant succession 
of names which appear, many of whom we can trace as 
having been in contact with Sufis, Sufi schools, or who use 
Sufi terminology. Bacon, for instance, did not merely read

Sufis. Lully not only studied Sufism in practice and used

come a Tiainp constantly invoked by later alchemists. The 
same trend was carried on by Paracelsus and others. 

Paracelsus, who traveled in the East and received his 
Sufic training in Turkey, introduced several Sufi terms into 
Western thought. His “Azoth,” is identical with the Sufi 
el-dkat (pronounced in Persian and hence in most Sufi 
poetry as az-zaut). Paragranwm is merely a Latinization of 
the science of the inner nature of things. 

Owing to the Reformation, Paracelsus had to be careful 
how he expressed himself; since he was projecting a psy¬ 
chological system different from either the Catholic or 
Protestant ways. In one place he says: "Read with the heart 
until at some future time the true religion will come.” He 
also used the “wine” analogy of Sufism, in referring to in¬ 
terior knowledge. As a result he was accused of being a 
drunkard. Only from a Sufi point of view could this passage 
of his be accepted: 

“Let us depart from all ceremonies, conjurations, con¬ 
secrations, etc., and all similar delusions, and put our heart, 
will and confidence solely upon the true rock. ... If we 
afr anAm selfishness the door will be opened for us, and 
that which is mysterious will be revealed.” (Philosophia 
Occulta) 

He even quotes Sufi dicta: 

“Salvation is not attained by fasting, neither wearing 



the philosophers stone 231 

certain clothes, nor by flagellation. These are supersti¬ 
tions and hypocrisy. God made everything pure and 

holy, man need not consecrate them. . . (Ibid.) 

Many occultists, in spite of this, continue to try to fol¬ 
low the alchemical and Cabalistic ideas attributed to 
Paracelsus. 

Henry Cornelius Agrippa (bom i486) was another ex¬ 
ample of what the Sufis call “precursors” or “scouts” (rah- 
bin ). He is supposed to have been an alchemist and magi¬ 
cian, and even today there are people who attempt to reach 
the truth through the magical system ascribed to him. He 
wrote on the method of Raymond Lully, lectured on Hermes, 
and undoubtedly knew of the Sufic interpretation of 
alchemy. 

Those who followed him, and those who consider him a 
fraud alike, would do well to reexamine his words in the 
Sufi light He said of alchemy: “This is that true and occult 
philosophy of the wonders of nature. The key thereof is 
the understanding—for the higher we carry our knowledge, 
the more sublime are our attainments in virtue, and we per¬ 
form the greatest things with more ease.” The stone of the 
alchemists who followed the “Art” literally was “vain and 
fictitious,” so long as they practiced that art literally, since 
“it is an internal spirit within us, which can very well per¬ 
form whatsoever the monstrous mathematicians, the prodi¬ 
gious magicians, the wonderful alchemists and the bewitch¬ 
ing necromancers can effect.” 

Since this is as far as any Sufi could go, especially sur¬ 
rounded by people who wanted to believe in the super¬ 
natural in a crude form, and since orthodox religion had a 
vested interest in maintaining supematuralism of the im¬ 
plausible sort, it is not surprising that such men as Agrippa 
have been considered deluded, magicians, or insane. 


Mysteries in the West 
I. Strange Rites 


In an instant, rise from time and space. 
Set the world aside and become a world 
within yourself. 

(Shabistari, Secret Garden ) 


It is the night of Saturday, especially consecrated to a ritual 
which is awesome to us, faithfully followed by the devotees 
of a certain cult. 

Two groups of twelve, dressed in colorful costumes, 
carry out complicated movements within an enclosed space. 
They at times respond to musical stimuli applied through a 
primitive instrument by a man of seeming authority who, 
with a few assistants, supervises their activity. Entirely sur¬ 
rounding the area devoted to the ritual, a congregation gives 
its responses. At times the people sing, sometimes they shout, 
sometimes they are silent. Some wield an instrument which 
gives forth a strange sound. 

Much care has evidently gone into the planning of the 
geometrically designed arena. Around it are colorful in¬ 
signia, flags, banners, decorations probably designed to raise 
the emotional pitch of the individual and the group. The 
atmosphere is eerie partly because of the abrupt changes in 
emotion. Their reaction to the ecstatogenic processes being 
enacted in their midst is so explosive at times that one won-

ders why they do not spill over into the sacred enclosure. 
Both joy and sorrow are manifested among the votaries. 

We are observers at a floodlit association football game. 
What is missing from the observer’s account is a knowledge 
of what is actually happening, and why. If we have this 
knowledge, we can identify the players, crowd, referee, the 
use of the chalked lines. If we do not, we continue: Here 
a man writhes on the ground, another grimaces, sweat pour¬ 
ing from his face. One of the audience strikes himself, 
another his neighbor. The totem rises into the air, and is 
hailed by an awesome roar from the assembly. . • * Then 
we see that blood has been shed. 

Other forms of ritual are subject to a similar approach 
by those who have not been through the experiences which 
precede their staging. Even more important, very many 
rituals of one kind or another have undergone alteration 
throughout the ages, the original intention or force being 
lost When this happens, there is a mechanical or associa¬ 
tive substitution of other factors. The ritual is distorted, even 
though there may be apparent reasons for its every aspect. 
This development is what we can call the dereliction of cult 
behavior. 

Here, now, is an externalist account of a dervish ritual, 
in which events are described from the point of view of the 
observer alone. The author is the Reverend John Subhan, of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church, who was present at this 
event in India: 

Tonight is Thursday night, the night which is specially 
sacred to the Sufi. Come, let us visit some shrines and 
see for ourselves what strange religious rites are prac¬ 
ticed almost at our very doors. 

We enter a dimly lighted room where a number of 
men are gathered. As we do so a signal is given by a 
man who appears to be the leader of the assembly, 
and the doors are shut. There is a hush as twelve men 
form into two parallel lines in the center of the room. 



THE SUFIS 


234 

The glimmer of a solitary hurricane lamp falls on 
dark faces in which only the eyes seem to live. The 
rest of us fall back to the sides of the room. The Dhikr 
is about to begin. 

With a startling clap of the hands the leader starts 
swaying from right to left Very slowly he begins, and 
the men fall into the rhythm of his swaying. Every 
time they sway to the left they call “Hu!” in chorus, 
“Hu. . . Hu. , . Hu.” 1 


The dervish ritual is not of the same nature of the football 
game—far from it. Since, however, it is not symbolic but 
concerned with an interior activity, the advantages of de¬ 
scribing such an event in this out-of-context manner are few. 

The atmosphere engendered by Sufic activity produces for 
the Sufi himself a perception, leaves a trace which he is 
able to recognize. It is, however, useless to say that one can 
recognize in the very being of a certain cult divorced from 
its origins a “sensation” that it was once a Sufic one. Mate¬ 
rial has to be made available in the form in which it can be 
shared by the reader, at least to some extent 

For this reason it is necessary to start with the inner per¬ 
ception that certain Western phenomena are of this origin, 
then to see what relatively acceptable formal material exists 
through which one can illustrate the fact. There are two 
main methods available for this. The first is to refer to the 
parallel phenomenon, if there is one, in the East. The other 
is to seek tracer elements, like technical terms and concealed 
meanings. In our case we use both, to shed light here upon 
at least one aspect of what has come to be called the witch 
cult of Western Europe. 

‘Witch,” as we are widely informed, simply means “wise.” 
This word could occur anywhere, and need not be a trans¬ 
lation from Arabic or anything else. ‘Wise” is a name used 

1 John A. Subhan, Sufism, Its Saints and Shrines, Lucknow, 1938, 
p. 1. 



STRANGE RITES 235 

by dervish cults, and also by the followers- of other more or 
less undiluted traditions. 

In Spanish, the word for witch is bruja, And it is in 
Spain that we find early and relatively complete accounts of 
the rituals and beliefs of the people of Western Europe who 
celebrated similar festivities and were considered by the 
Church to be votaries of the Black One. 

We can follow up the clue which is contained in the fact 
that the maskkara dervishes, although they are found 
nowadays mosdy in pockets of Central Asia and occasionally 
in India, use the Arabic word whose radical is BRSH. 

The maskhara , “revelers,” are also called mabrush, 
“marked on the skin,” or possibly “intoxicated by the thorn 
apple.” In Spanish, maja is the Latin-based word, while 
bruja (pronounced brushd) is the word which appeared in 
Saracen Spain to describe these people. If we assume, for the 
moment, that brusha might be a descriptive term adopted 
by a Reveler group, we can try to decode allied descriptive 
uses by means of Arabic poetic method. What, in fact, does 
brusha mean, both in its root form and in its derivations? 
According to our poetic code-method, a number of words 
of the same consonantal group are taken to add up to a 
description of a cult—as we have seen in the case of “Sufi.” 

Dictionary words give us a selection of—a hallucinogenic 
substance^ a symbol, and a ritual mark, all under this gen¬ 
eral consonantal grouping: 

BRSH = Datura stramonium (thorn apple), pro¬ 
nounced BaRSH. Alternatively, by similarity of sound: 

YBRUH = root of the mandrake (Syriac loanword), 
pronounced YaBRUUHH. Both of these contain alkaloids. 
Both were reputed to have been used by witches, to induce 
visions, sensations of flying, and in rituals. 

What is a symbol associated with witches? A broom: 

M-BRSHa = a brush, broom, scraper (Syrian 2 dia¬ 
lect), pronounced MiBRSHA. 

2 Under the Saracens, there were huge numbers of Syrians in 
Spain. The Norman-Syrian contact could have been as early as 
844 AJD. when Seville was pillaged. 



TOE SUEIS 


236 

Translating from the group of words, we can therefore 
describe a community of people associating themselves with 
this letter arrangement as: “Associated with the mandrake 
(or thorn apple); using the symbol of the broom, identified 
by a mark on the skin, wearing a particolored or motley 
garb.” Such people would be most accurately described in 
Arabic, and in medieval Spain, as brujo (masculine) or 
bruja (feminine), pronounced at the time brusho, brushcu 
If we accept the connection with the Revelers, we can as¬ 
sociate further. Their use of the mandrake would provide a 
further homonym—the colloquialism mabrush, mabrusha, 
“frenzied,” a reference to their dancing. The traditional 
witches' dance has been identified with, or at least com¬ 
pared to, two forms of dance known in Europe—that of the 
Saracens, the waltz (which is supposed to have come from 
Asia through the Balkans), and the dibka, the Middle 
Eastern ring dance, known from the Mediterranean to the 
Persian Gulf. 

But there are still numerous other witch facts which can 
be added to this. Arabic sources quoted by Arkon Daraul 
speak of the "dance of the two-homed,” and give us the due 
to the meanings of the "barbarous” words used by witches, 
which members of the fraternity even today cannot under¬ 
stand. Here are some of them, with their Arabic equivalent: 

The ritual knife, cryptically called “Athame.” From 
adhdhame, a bloodletter. “Athame” is a very fair at¬ 
tempt at the sound represented by adh-dhame . The 
Sab(b)at(h), confused by confluence with the He¬ 
brew word, turns up in our Arabic text about the 
Spanish two-homed people as in fact originating in 
Az-ZABAT, “the forceful (occasion).” A fanciful 
later etymology is through French sebattre, “to frolic.” 
The same association of sound converted into Robin, 
Robinet, the perfectly apposite Semitic R abba, “lord,” 
the elusive and mysterious lord or functionary of the 



STRANGE RITES 


237 

Sab at. Robb anal (O our lord!) is part of the Moslem 

prayer, emphatically stressed aloud five times a day. 

The very word “coven” eventually found an apparent 
identification with the idea of convening or gathering to¬ 
gether. Yet in the recital of the ritual by a former member of 
the ancient Hispano-Semitic cult, kafan refers to the shroud 
which is placed over the heads of the Revelers while they 
are dancing, reported in witch material from as far away as 
Scandinavia. By later association it may have come to mean 
the meeting or the members, but Kafan was certainly used 
in the earlier form, and means winding-sheet. 

We can now go on to a further stage—the witches' oint¬ 
ment and what it might have been composed of. Why was 
the ointment originally used? In Arabic, “ointment” is 
RHM, the word which also stands for blood kindred. Oint¬ 
ment was given to the witch, male or female, after initiation, 
and after being marked. Marham, ointment, is rubbed on to 
the skin with a view to establishing a symbolic form of blood 
kinship. Thus, by an “anointing,” if we can talk in Semitic 
roots, the ointment (RHM) is applied to help create the 
condition of blood kinship (RHM). It was to be used in the 
future, to take the witch to his or her kindred, RHM. So 
the RHM formed the mental, pharmacological link with the 
RHM. 

But was there no alkaloid or other active principle in the 
witch ointment? There most certainly was. It will be remem¬ 
bered that the witches made a brew from the bodies or 
severed members of unbaptized babies. The mandrake root, 
it will be remembered, is “human” in shape. It is tradition¬ 
ally thought of as a tiny simulacrum of a human being. A 
tiny human being is a child. As a plant, we could hardly 
expect it to be duly baptized. And ingredients of the oint¬ 
ment seem to be this form of an “unbaptized one.” 

Too many analogies have been sought for witch practices 
in Christianity or pagan cults of a pre-Christian kind. If 
you read works on witchcraft in Europe, you will find that 



238 THE SUEIS 

as far as most of their authors are concerned, there was no 
such thing as centuries of Saracen rule in Spain, or genera¬ 
tions of absorption of Eastern culture on every level. Even 
the name (the Wise Ones) could be a direct translation of 
arifin, the title assumed by people in the East who believed 
in the possibility of direct communication with the super¬ 
natural. 

Modem witches seem uncertain about the significance of 
the size of their circle (nine feet in diameter) and know 
little about their old numerology. But this material is avail¬ 
able elsewhere, even to the measurements. Their own tradi¬ 
tion is, incidentally, that they come from the "Summer 
Land," which is taken by their present-day members to mean 
the East. Their black man (Moor) and homed fetish (the 
devil, confused with the moon) belong to the realm of recent 
operation ("working") for recently there has been an at¬ 
tempted rationalization of their cult, tracing it to seasonal 
and other festivals, and an amalgamation with ecstatic cults, 
using the Arab code system to formulate their rituals. 

Who brought the witches to the West? In the medieval 
form, from which most of our information derives, un¬ 
doubtedly the Aniza tribe. We have to go back to the deserts 
of Arabia. 

The mighty Aniza Bedouin clan, most numerous in fight¬ 
ing men and richest in pedigree camels, is marked in Arab 
literature for its bitterness in desert war. Bedouin wars pro¬ 
vided material for the development of die chivalric code, and 
for love and battle epics. Not to mention the dibka dance 
and the bloodletting knife. The patterns of poetry developed 
by tribal bards was to influence the literature of a score of 
nations after the expansion of Islam to the north, east and 
west 

The genesis of the Bedouin life lay in pre-Islamic times, 
in the Days of the Arabs, each Day being an epic of some 
battle whose origin may be forgotten, but whose cultural 
by-products, in verse, nobility of conduct or military tactics, 
remained a part of the tribe’s heritage. 



STRANGE RITES 


2-39 

This is the Bedouin of the storybooks—the untamed war¬ 
rior whose gendeness with women and children is proverbial 
and balanced by his determination to fight to the death for 
a trickle of possibly muddy water or a palm tree; but who 
would give absolutely everything away in one magnificent 
gesture. 

One of the earliest and most bloody of the Days was 
that which lasted forty years at the end of the fifth century, 
fought between two sections of the Aniza. Starting with the 
theft of an ailing she-camel belonging to an old woman, it 
ended—as the Days often did—by an act of mediation. Its 
end product, characteristic of Saracenic romance, and which 
influenced all Western literature, was the most famous 
heroic romance tale of Arabia, the Story of el-Zir. 

History brought these people to Europe, and with them 
much of their culture. One of them was a dervish teacher, 
deeply involved with the musical, romantic and tribal tradi¬ 
tions of his tribe. 

The parent tribe of the Aniza are held by all Bedouin 
bards to be the Fakir ("humble in spirit”) clan. This appel¬ 
lation was adopted by dervishes, and in one of its deteriora¬ 
tions is applied to itinerant Hindu imitation yogis who 
autoanesthetize themselves and lie on sharp barbs, to no 
clearly ascertainable purpose; unless it be that a moity of 
onlookers may hope to be able to emulate them. 

The Fakir tribe still lives in northwest Arabia, near their 
ancestral settlement of Khaibar, the ancient town which 
was a stronghold in Mohammed's time. The Aniza have 
many legends, one of them associated with their necessary 
outward proliferation. According to this story, Wail, the 
Fakir and ancestor of the whole Aniza, on one "Night of 
Power” (probably the twenty-seventh of the month of 
Ramadan) made a supplication. He laid one hand on him¬ 
self and one on his magnificent she-camel, and prayed that 
the seed of both should multiply. The result, we are told, 
is that the Aniza are now fertile in both fields, with a cur¬ 
rent strength of some thirty-seven thousand men and about

a million head of camels. They have fertility-increasing 
powers as well. Their tradition has passed, too, into the be¬ 
liefs of those cults which are dependent upon Aniza member¬ 
ship. 

Today they are plentiful in the Syrian desert, having 
fought their way into occupation there over a period of 
nearly two centuries, ending about the year 1600 AD. The 
cult of the Revelers which is connected with their name, 
however, goes back at least to Abu el-Atahiyya (748-0* 828). 
A potter and contemplative, he yearned for a greater balance 
between the glories of Baghdad at the time of Haroun el- 
Rashid the great Caliph, and the development of innate 
human faculties. He said so to the Caliph, who settled upon 
him an annuity of fifty thousand silver pieces. 

He became a writer, and left a collection of mystical verse 
which “entitle him to the position of father of Arabic sacred 
poetry.” 

His circle of disciples, the Wise Ones, commemorated him 
in a number of ways after his death. To signify his tribe, 
they adopted the goat, cognate with the tribal name QAnz, 
Aniza). A torch between goat horns (“the devil” in Spain, 
as it later became) symbolized for them the light of illu¬ 
mination from the intellect (head) of the “goat,” the Aniza 
teacher. His wasm (tribal brand) was very much like a 
broad arrow, also called an eagle’s foot. An alternative name 
for the Aniza is a kind of bird. This sign, known to witches 
as the goosefoot, became the mark for their places of meeting. 
Some of his followers, especially the young females, were 
marked with a small tattoo or other mark, in conformity 
with Bedouin custom. After Atahiyya’s death' before the 
middle of the ninth century, tradition has it that a group of 
his school migrated to Spain, which had been under Arab 
rule for over a century at that time. 

The symbols and customs associated with the tribal af¬ 
filiation continued to be used. This is in conformity with 
dervish practice. Each teacher gives a special flavoring to his 
school, which changes when the school is taken over by

another teacher. The object here is to retain group feeling . 3 

All this is not to say that there was no earlier cult in Eu¬ 
rope of much the same type. But it does seem to show the 
elision of the two into what eventually frightened the 
Church of the middle ages, and has remained a piquant 
mystery to all kinds of people ever since. Even the female 
lore of the witches is in parts so close to the Sufi love poetry 
of the middle ages, especially that of the Spaniard Ibn El- 
Arabi, that little more need be said on this point. 

The Quresh are the noblest tribe of Arabia, and the 
supreme clan is the Hashimite. They can be considered 
something apart, for they are the prophetic and royal blood. 
Next to them, however, come the mighty Aniza. Three rulers 
today are from this clan—the Saudi-Arabian king, the Sheikh 
of Kuwait, and the Ruler of Bahrain. 

This material gives us three main possibilities, or ways of 
assessing and describing, the meetings of the witches of the 
West. The first we could call the survival of the old (pre- 
Christian) religion; the second, the importation of the Sara¬ 
cenic cult; the third, an antichristian development. Any or 
all of these, of course, can contain outside elements. 

The supporters of the “old religion” theory have pressed 
everything they can find into service. Horns can for them 
only stand for the survival of a hunting or fertility rite; the 
dance for this, the animal guise for that. The clerical ob¬ 
servers have stressed the feast as a blasphemous sacrament, 
the marking as a travesty of baptism, and so on. 

Like our different versions of a football game, the inter¬ 
pretation depends upon knowing what was actually going 
on, not upon our assumptions that because something was 
found in a certain place at a certain time it must accord 
with our theory or assumption as to what it was. “Devil, 
horns, boiled babies” is the one version. “God and goddess, 
fertility dance, secrecy to maintain the old religion” is the

overwhelmed the Suii element. Successive inductions of Bedouins into 
the cult was almost certainly responsible for its reversion to tribalism.

other. The third is—“symbol of the Amza tribe, its teacher, 
the hallucinogen.” 

The term “old religion,” which witches and others accept 
as an indication of the prehistoric origins of the cult, is a 
standard Sufi phrase, often used, as “antique faith, old 
one,” “ancient tradition.” It was stressed by Ibn El-Arabi 
the Spanish Sufi, in his love poems. 

If the ancient tradition did indeed exist in Europe before 
the eighth century, when the Saracens occupied its main 
centers, it undoubtedly underwent a complete penetration 
of the poetic code-system, Sufi terminology and Arab tribal 
symbolism for which there can hardly be a parallel analogue 
of equal depth of influence. 

What more can we find out from the phrase “the antique 
faith,” or “the ancient tradition?” Translate “antique,” 
“ancient” into the basic Arabic triliteral root of QDM 4 and 
we get the poetic meaning: 

QDM = concept of precedence. 

Here are some of the main derivations from this root, to 
be found in any Arab dictionary: 

Qidam (QiDM) = precedence, preexistence 

Qidman (QiDM an ) = old, olden times 

Qadam (QaDaM) = high rank, bravery 

Qadam (QaDaM) = human foot, step, stage of movement 

Qadum (QaDUM) = an axe 

Qadim (QADiM) = future 

El-Qadim (EL-QaDiM) = the Ancient One (God) 

Qaddam (QaDDAM) = chief, leader 

This strange word stands for eternity in the sense that it 
shows that time is eternal. An equivalent in English might 
be “precedence,” which carries the meaning of preceding 
(hence being past) and going forward (meaning ahead). 
The axe carried by dervish wanderers is called qadum .

and Future).

There are two Ancient Ones—the Ancient (Sheikh, Pir) of 
the Sufis, and the Ancient One (the deity). This possibility 
of two sorts of preeminent and ancient ones, one human 
(die leader of the group) and the other the higher (divine) 
one, is intended to convey a very subtle concept. The Sufis 
have often been accused of believing that their leaders are 
divine. Through the special, or poetic, use of this word 
they actually show that there are two versions which this 
Ancient may take, 5 The one is the teacher who has certain 
qualities of a supreme character, as near to deity as may 
be perceived in a man. Both the Sufis and the witches use 
a ceremonial limp or staggered step to convey the sense of 
the Arabic word qadam, a step. There is one important dif¬ 
ference in the Eastern and Western versions. In die East the 
word qadam (step, stage) is mimed for purposes of crypto¬ 
graphic transmission. The Sufi takes a step sideways, or 
stamps, in order to commemorate the actual root word. 
When he makes a definite step, either as a recognition signal 
or during a ceremony, he is doing this to affirm the contin¬ 
ued transmission of the three-letter word QDM. By working 
this word into the proceedings, the framers of the ritual or 
password system have made sure of his survival—at least 
among people who can understand Arabic words to any 
extent. 

In my own experience, when instructed in the method of 
making a certain step-signal, I was sent away to study all the 
elements of the word for “step.” From this study, in turn, 
emerges the realization that the system is the “antique faith,” 
that it is divided into stages or steps, that it proceeds step by 
step, that it is ahead as well as of the greatest antiquity. 

It is more than obvious that in the transmission of outer 
forms in non-Arabic speaking countries, a similar adaptation 

6 “There is another peculiarity of this language, the suggestive 
and meaningful nature of its words. Arabic words to a Sufi strike 
them as eloquent. They do convey what, in other languages, need 
pages to explain. They therefore are most suitable to convey occult 
conceptions. (Sheikh el Mushaikh, Tasawwufal Island, London, 
1933 [Islamic Sufism, by I, A. Shah] p. 39.)

of words has not taken place. Ideally, if the idea of an an¬ 
tique faith with a progressive destiny were translated into 
English by witches or whatever they might be called, they 
should have chosen such a word as “succeed.” Succession 
means to “come after,” but it also connotes something which 
is to be in the future, something which can be attained. 
Speaking from the point of view of the process which is be¬ 
ing described, then, the ancient knowledge would have to 
become known in its Western transition as “succeed .” 6 

The change from one language to another where the old 
allusions remain is against the evolutionary idea of the Sufis. 
And it is this very metamorphosis which makes the Sufic 
development very difficult to study in an academic way. Gen¬ 
erally speaking, only the moribund versions, which have lost 
their movement, will be available. 

6 The Swedish witches of Mohra adapted the concept correctly 
when they hailed their leader as “Antecessor.” 


Mysteries in the West 
II. The Chivalric Circle 


When you are still fragmentated, 
lacking certainty—what difference 
does it make what your decisions are? 

(Hakim Sanai, The Walled Garden of Truth ) 


A group of Sufis is formulating an association which shall 
enable them to carry on their work of human development 
toward self-fulfillment. The work, as with all Sufic activities, 
has three parts. The individual himself must live up to 
certain personal standards, and they choose the medieval 
ideal of chivalry as their format. This, in turn, gives them 
an opportunity of forming a visible elite. The existence and 
appearance of this elite fulfills the second function—the 
impact upon humanity in general. The third element, rev¬ 
erence for the teacher, is invested in the Sufic “king” figure, 
who leads the community. 

They choose, as an external form, the hooded woolen 
robe of blue which is standard wear among Sufis. For color 
symbolism they adopt gold and blue, to signify the essence 
within the body or mind—the sun in the sky or the “speck 
of gold within the sea,” as the Sufi sage Attar puts it. The 
basic unit of the Sufi is the Circle, the halka. In their com¬ 
memorative rituals they carry out the exercises or movements 
collectively known as the “dance.” As their slogan they take 



THE SUFIS 


246 

an Arabic motto, about a cupbearer. This is translated in 
the Persian branches in a rhyming sentence, with almost 
the same sounds as the motto of the Garter Order. 

Their patron saint is Khidr, the Green One. 

The halkas are composed of thirteen people. There are 
two reasons for this number being used. In the first place, 
these Sufis wish to emphasize their inner teaching as being 
the same as that of all religions. It is the secret, concealed 
message of all faiths—the need for organized development. 
In this case, the other religion with which these Moslem 
Sufis are most concerned is Christianity. The acceptance 
of the identity of Christianity and Islam is conveyed by 
simple numerology. 

“Unity," the Sufis of the Khidr Order explain by their 
symbolism, is the same as “three” for practical purposes. They 
demonstrate this by pointing out that the Arabic word 
“unity” Qahad ')—the adjective used for Allah the One—is 
composed of three letters in Arabic—AHD. Therefore three 
is one, because the difference between monotheism and 
Christianity is one of terminology. 

But where does the thirteen come into the picture? Quite 
simply. In Arabic notation, A equals one, H has the numeri¬ 
cal value of eight, and D is equal to the number four. Add 
these together and the result is thirteen. Thirteen therefore 
becomes a number important to this Sufi group. 

Halkas of this persuasion are thus always grouped into 
thirteen. Thirteen men form one unit. 

The reputed date of the formation of this organization 
is about the year 1200 of the Christian era. 

About a century and a half later (nobody is quite sure of 
the date) a mysterious organization came into being in Eng¬ 
land. It was inspired by the King himself. The members 
were divided into two sections of thirteen each—one under 
King Edward III, the other under the Black Prince. Its 
colors were blue and gold, its robes woolen and hooded, 
its aims overtly chivalric. Its patron saint was St. George, 
who is equated in Syria, where his cult originates, with the 



THE CHIVALIIIC CIRCLE 247 

mysterious Khidr-figure of the Sufis. It was, in fact, called 
the Order of St. George, which would translate direct into 
Sufi phraseology as Tarika-i-Hadrat-i~Khidr (the Order 
of St. Khidr). It became known as the Order of the Garter. 
The word “garter" in Arabic is the same as the word for the 
Sufi mystical tie or bond, and also “religious or monkish 
asceticism." The word for the basic Sufi unit Qialka) is 
interchangeable in Sufi parlance with the very same radical 
from which “garter" is derived. 

The early records of the Order of the Garter are lost. 
Speculation as to the derivations and origins of the Order 
have replaced them. The pretty story that the Order was 
instituted as a result of someone sneering at a real garter, 
while discounted by some serious historians, may in fact 
have a very interesting basis in fact. It may be recalled that 
this incident is said to have taken place at a dance. If we 
look at the facts from the Sufi historical point of view, we 
can ask something which may not have occurred to others. 
What kind of dance was it? The whole incident looks like 
an attempt to explain away a dance ritual which was in 
some way interrupted and had to be justified. A garbled 
version is likely to have come down to us. Why, for instance, 
was a garter being displayed at a dance, if this is what was 
happening? Either because the garter was chosen to repre¬ 
sent in visual form the “tie" of the Order; or because “some 
lad/s garter had fallen off." 

What is the slogan of the Order of the Garter, and does it 
have any connection with the Khidr Order? Superficially 
there is no connection between “Dishonored be he who 
thinks evil of it," and the secret “cupbearer" phrase. If we 
approach the matter from conventional method, we will 
never see the connection. But if we go by sound rather than 
meaning, for the time being, a strange fact emerges. The 
French version of the slogan and the Arabic and Persian 
ones sound almost like the same words. 

Those who have read even translations of Persian Sufi 



THE SUFIS 


248 

poets, with their cupbearers as the medium of the enlighten¬ 
ment of the Sufi, will see the connection. 

The process by means of which a foreign word or phrase 
becomes adopted into another language is well established 
in literature and custom. There are numerous examples, 
and the system has even been named, being catalogued in 
dictionaries as Hobson-Jobson. The interminable religious 
chant in India, Ya Hasan Ya Hussein (O Hasan! O Hus¬ 
sein!) is accepted in English under the sound Hobson- 
Jobson, an attempt by British soldiers to reproduce the 
chant. The standard Indian dictionary of Anglo-Indian 
terms, containing many examples of the process, is actually 
called Hobson-Jobson. In West Africa the Arabic word 
el-ghaita (a bagpipe) has been anglicized into "alligator.” 
Nearer home, all Londoners are familiar with the name of 
a certain tavern, the "Elephant and Castle,” originally 
named the Infanta de Castile . 

Quite recently, a Middle Eastern friend of mine pre¬ 
sented an astonished barrow-pushing scrap collector with a 
shilling in a London street. The man had been repeating, 
with fervor, in that plaintive tone of the hawker, "Any old 
iron?” The way in which he drew out the sounds was for 
my friend indistinguishable from the mendicant dervish cry 
of O Imam Reza! which shouting dervishes repeat hundreds 
of times a day as a pious invocation, heard by all in some 
areas. 

Shakespeare’s name is sometimes rendered in perfectly 
correct and acceptable Persian as Sheikh-Peer, "the ancient 
sage.” 

A society with secret phrases, or which had to suffer an 
interruption during a ritual, would have need to explain 
what a barbarous phrase meant, and what exactly was the 
basis for elevating a garter. There is a great deal of other 
material which links these two movements, much of it ini¬ 
tiatory in character and which cannot be reproduced here. 
It may be said, however, that an alternative name for a 
branch of the Khidr Order is el-mudawwira (tbe round 



THE CHIVALRIC CIRCLE 249 

building), associated with the great palace of Baghdad 
which belonged to Haroun el-Rashid. The entire city of 
Baghdad was constructed in 762 A.D., in certain geo¬ 
metrical proportions based on the wheel. Traditional Sufi 
groups, like the Freemasons of the West, associate their dedi¬ 
cation with this round building. It may only be a coinci¬ 
dence that the Garter Order was concerned with the Round 
Table revival, and that King Philip of Valois was also 
anxious to start a new Round Table group. 

Until the time of Edward VI (died 1553) the Order was 
called that of St. George, patron saint of England; although 
the traditional connection with a garter reaches back to the 
origins of the Order. It is just possible that two hundred 
years after its first institution the meaning of the word 
“garter” was sufficiently well understood for this to become 
the actual name of the Order. Successive alterations to the 
ritual and numbers of the knights have virtually changed 
the originally Sufic coincidence. 

Today the Order of the Garter is still the most important 
and proudest institution of England. The idea that it may 
be of foreign derivation is unwelcome to some people. 
These, however, are only those who fail to realize that, what¬ 
ever its origins, it is in England that the Order has attained 
its greatest distinction, worthily maintaining an honorable 
roll of elite. 

Those who have sought in the Garter a connection with 
the strange tradition of the witches may not be as wide of 
the mark as others might think. At least one branch of this 
fragmentary cult in Britain is heavily influenced by Spanish- 
Saracen transmission of a deteriorated Sufi type, where a 
vague “magical power” idea has replaced the theme of 
baraka. 

There is a very coherent reason for the Sufi group com¬ 
bining the elements of blue, gold, kingship, Khidr (St. 
George) and the protection of women into their formula¬ 
tion. It is all based upon a single word root and its manipu¬ 
lation, though a similar consistency cannot be found in the 



THE SUFIS 


250 

Order of lie Garter. This might lead one to suppose that 
the Garter is a translation of the essential qualities of the 
Khidr group, all of which can be found assembled in the 
triliteral root KHDR. 

The elements used in the format and rituals of the group 
are all found here: 

KHaDiR = to be green (Islam, the matrix of the 
group) 

KHuDDiR la fi hi = he was blessed in it (the bene¬ 
diction of the group) 

KHiDaR, KHiDiR = St. George, Elias, the Patron 
of the Sufis, Khidr 

ElKHuDRat = the sea (the ocean of life, in which 
the Sufi finds truth; the sea, of which the Sufi is a 
wave, much used in poetry; the blue in which is 
the gold) 

AKHDaR = suspicious; fine woman (chivalry, refer¬ 
ring to the first Islamic order of chivalry, when 
Mohammed early in the seventh century founded 
a body of men to protect women and caravans) 

KHaDRa = chief of a tribe 

ElKHaDRa = the sky, firmament (from which the 
sun breaks through, another allusion to the gold in 
the blue) 

ElaKHaBiR = gold, meat and wine. (The gold ele¬ 
ment of the sky or sea—the meat and wine which 
are common denominators with Christian ritual. 
The Christian ritual itself is regarded as symboli¬ 
cal of the totality of the whole community and 
individual development, so that the sacraments of 
the Church are to the Sufi merely a fragment of 
the whole undertaking as given above.) 

The emblem of the group is the palm tree, which is de¬ 
rived from the root khadar, to cut a palm tree. The tree it¬ 
self, as noted elsewhere in this book, signifies haraka and 
other basic elements of Sufism, emblazoned upon the cryptic 



THE CHIVALRIC CIRCLE 25 1 

Hohenstaufen coronation robe of the kings of Sicily and 
the Holy Roman Emperor, who were known to have Sufi 
contacts. 

The time of Edward III in England certainly did see an 
extension of Saracenic elements into Europe. English na¬ 
tional dancing, the Morris, must be of these origins. Cecil 
Sharp—the authority on English folk dance—-has linked 
European “Moorish” dancing and the probable date of its 
entry into England: 

The Morris, then—once also the Moresc—of Eng¬ 
land; Le Morisque and Morisco of France; the 
Moresca of Corsica . . . is in all reasonable probability 
Moorish in origin: never mind if in our own country 
it is become as English as fisticuffs. . . . Holland, as is 
told by Engel, was infected too; industrious research, 
in fact, will probably show that the Morris in some 
shape or other was known throughout Europe, and be¬ 
yond. As for the date of its introduction into England 
that is impossible to state with certainty; but most 
authorities point to the time of Edward III. Maybe 
when John of Gaunt returned from Spain is probably 
the earliest when Morris-men were seen in England. 1 

These dances may have been imported direct from Moor¬ 
ish Spain in those times, but they are traceable to Sufi 
fraternities much further back in time. The riding of a 
hobbyhorse (Basque zamalzain, from Arabic zamil el-zain, 
“gala limping horse” 2 ) is only a part of Sufic ritual. These 
entertainers are not only “certainly reminiscent of Arab 
minstrels;” they are representative of the humorous poets in 
gaudy dress, long hair and painted faces who act out certain 
metaphysical teachings to this day among the Sufis. Some¬ 
times they rode hobbyhorses, sometimes canes, feigning 
idiocy as “fools of God.” One such dervish stick rider

connection with the BRSH (bruja = witch) riders of 
Spain. 

The first Sufi record of a teaching journey to England 3 
—such is contained in the travels of Najmuddin (Star of 
Faith) Gwath-ed-Dahar Qalandar. He was bom about 
1232, or perhaps earlier. His son, or another successor 
(Najmuddin Baba), “followed his father’s footsteps” from 
India to England and China in 1338. 

The first Najmuddin was a disciple of the illustrious 
Nizamuddin Awlia of Delhi, who sent him to Rum (Tur¬ 
key) to study under Khidr Rumi. Khidr Rumi’s full name 
was Sayed Khidr Rumi Khapradari—the Cupbearer—of 
Turkestan. It will be remembered that the Khidr Order 
(equated with the Garter) has as its slogan a salutation to 
the cupbearer. This cup had miraculous qualities. 

Legend has it that this dervish carried with him the in¬ 
terpretation of the Sufi sign hoo (which in stylized cal¬ 
ligraphy looks like the number four)—the Mason’s mark 
found on Gothic buildings in the West In addition to its 
forming a framework for the Sufi “magic square,” it is also 
used by the Qalandars as a diagram of the three devotional 
positions (upright, kneeling and lying down), which may 
be equivalent to the “instruments” of the Masons. 

Najmuddins teacher, Sayed Khidr, was an associate of 
the Sufi teacher Suhrawardi (of the Path of the Rose, some¬ 
times equated with the Rosicrucians); of Abdul Qadir, Rose 
of Baghdad; and the father of Jalaluddin Rumi (some of 
whose stories are found in Chaucer, and who was writing 
at the time of the alleged journey to England); as well as 
other very important Sufi teachers like Fariduddin Sha- 
karganj and Shah Madar. Shah Madar taught the essential 
unity of all religions, especially the esoteric way of Islam 
and Christianity. He followed the teachings of Tayfuri and

the formulation of the King or Lord of the Fish, Dhu’l- 
Nun the Egyptian, or the “Black.” 

Fariduddin Shakarganj (Father Farid of the Sweet 
Treasure) was of the Chis(h)ti School of Sufis, and was 
originally a nobleman of Afghanistan. He died in India in 
1265, where his tomb is revered by people of all faiths. His 
functions were healing and music. The Chis(h)ti musi¬ 
cians, who wandered through Asia with fife and drum, as¬ 
sembling the populace and telling stories of Sufi meaning, 
may be connected with the Spanish chistu or jester, whose 
costume was strikingly similar. 

The Sufi wanderers called Qalandars and Chis(h)tis 
must have brought to the West other dances, as well as 
rhythmic ritualistic procedures, and those which are in part 
represented by the Morris man. 

Hugo of Reutlingen, as an instance, in his Weltchronik 
of 1349, quoted by Dr. Nettl, speaks of the song in F major 
used by dancing bands which “reminds us of the Arabian 
dance of the dervishes.” 4

Mysteries in the West 
III. The Head of Wisdom 


This day and that alike you do within your 
garden spend. . . . 

Neglectful of the nightingale, the crow your 
chosen friend. 

Yet such companionship must leave its trace 
upon your soul: 

Do you thi-nlc fire shall cease to bum, or oil 
and water blend? 

(Divan of Bedil, Johnson Pasha’s translation) 


When they were suppressed, the Knights Templar were 
accused of worshiping a head, sometimes called the Bap- 
homet or Bafomet. This was considered to be an idol, and 
probably connected with Mohammed (Mahomet). The 
head was described, but no head which could positively be 
identified as one of these Bafomets could be located. 

Probably relying upon contemporary Eastern sources, 
Western scholars have recently supposed that "Bafomet has 
no connection with Mohammed, but could well be a cor¬ 
ruption of the Arabic ubufthuvuit (pronounced in Moorish 
Spanish something like bufihimat). The word means 
"father of understanding.” In Arabic, "father” is taken to 
mean "source, chief seat of,” and so on. In Sufi terminology, 
ras el-fahmat (head of knowledge) means the mentation of 
man after undergoing refinement—the transmuted con¬ 
sciousness. 

It will be noted that the word "knowledge, understand¬ 
ing” used here is derived from the Arabic FHM rbot. FHM, 
in turn, is used to stand both for FHM and derivatives, 



THE HEAD OE WISDOM 


255 

meaning “knowledge;” and FHM and derivatives, standing 
for “black, Coalman” and so on. 

The Baphomet is none other than the symbol of the com¬ 
pleted man. The black head, negro head, or Turk’s head 
which appears in heraldry and in English country-inn signs 
is a crusader substitute word (cant word) for this kind of 
knowledge. 

It may be noted that the shield of Hugues de Payen, 
the founder (with Bisol de St. Omer) of the Templars in 
1118 A.D., carried three black human heads—the heads of 
knowledge. 

The use of this term, especially the “wondrous head” 
theme, recurs throughout medieval history. Pope Gerbert 
(Silvester II) who studied in Moorish Spain, is stated to 
have made a brazen head, among many other marvelous 
“magical” things. 1 Albertus Magnus spent thirty years mak¬ 
ing his marvelous brass head. Thomas Aquinas, pupil at the 
time to Albertus, smashed the head, which “talked too 
much.” 

The head appears again and again. 

It should be remembered that the Templars and gradu¬ 
ates of the Spanish magical schools had one thing in com¬ 
mon, apart from being suspected of heresy and magical 
powers and belonging to secret organizations. They all 
spoke and used Arabic. By means of this initiatory lan¬ 
guage, they could communicate with one another, pass pun¬ 
ning messages, put up signs (like the ‘hat” of Majorca) to 
illustrate some message. 

This artificial head is not made of brass. Artificial it is, 
in that it is the product of “work” in the Sufic sense. Ulti¬ 
mately, of course, it is the head of the individual himself. 
At least one chronicler gets close to the mark when he 
says that the ‘head was flesh and blood, like unto an ordi¬ 
nary man’s.” The emphasis which is put on the statement, 
however, leads the ordinary reader to the conventional idea 

1 He is said to have introduced Arabic numerals into northern 
Europe in 991, from Saracen Spain. 



THE SUFIS 


256 

of artificiality, and like a good conjuring trick, diverts at¬ 
tention from the method of making the head, which might 
be suspected if it were thought that “head” was a code word 
for the result of a (heretical) formative process. 

In Arabic, “brass” is spelled SuFR, connected with the 
concept of “yellowness.” The “head of brass” is a rhyming 
homonym for “head of gold,” which is spelled in exactly the 
same way. The Golden Head (sar-i-tiZai) is a Sufi phrase 
used to refer to a person whose inner consciousness has 
been “transmuted into gold” by means of Sufic study and 
activity, the nature of which it is not permissible to convey 
here. 

The three heads of black wisdom on the shield of the 
founder of the Templars are shown on a background of 
gold—“On gold, three Moors' heads black.” 

The phrase, “I am making a head,” used by dervishes to 
indicate their Sufic dedication in certain exercises, could 
very well have been used by Albertus Magnus or Pope 
Silvester, and transmitted in the literal sense, believed to 
refer to some sort of artifact. 

Albertus Magnus (born 1193) was well versed in the 
Saracenic and Sufi literature and philosophy. As Professor 
Browne notes, he exceeded the usual customs of Western 
Orientalists, for, “dressed as an Arab [he] expounded at 
Paris the teachings of Aristotle from the works of al-Farabi, 
Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ghazali.” 



Mysteries in the West 
IV. Francis of Assisi 


Even though you tie a hunched knots 
—the string remains one. 

CRumQ 


Most people know that St. Francis of Assisi was a light¬ 
hearted troubador of Italy who experienced a religious con¬ 
version and became a saint with an uncanny influence 
over animals and birds. It is on record that the troubadors 
were a relic of Saracenic musicians and poets. It is often 
agreed that the rise and development of the monkish Orders 
in the middle ages was greatly influenced by the penetration 
of Moslem dervish organization in the West Studying St. 
Francis from this point of view, certain interesting dis¬ 
coveries become possible. 

Francis was bom in 1182, the son of Pietro Bemardone, 
a merchant of fine stuffs, and his wife, Madonna Pica. He 
was originally named Giovanni, but his father was so at¬ 
tached to France (where he spent much of his commercial 
life) that “for love of the land he had just quitted” he re¬ 
named the child Francesco. 

Although considered an Italian, Francis spoke Provengal, 
the language used by the troubadors. There is little doubt 
that he felt in the spirit of the troubadors a glimpse of some-

thing deeper than appeared on the surface. His own poetry 
so strongly resembles in places that of the love poet Rumi 
that one is tempted to look for any report which might con¬ 
nect Francis with the Sufi order of the Whirling Dervishes. 
At this point we come across the first of a number of tales 
considered inexplicable by Western biographers. 

The Whirling Dervishes can attain intuitive knowledge 
partly by a peculiar form of spinning, presided over by an 
instructor. Rumi's school of Whirling Dervishes was in full 
operation in Asia Minor, and its founder was still alive, 
during the lifetime of St. Francis. 

Here is the puzzling “spinning” tale: 

Francis was walking through Tuscany with a disciple, 
Brother Masseo. They arrived at a fork in the road. One 
path led to Florence, another to Arezzo, a third to Siena. 

Masseo asked which branch they should take. 

“The road which God wills.” 

“And which is that?” 

“We will know by a sign. I command you, by your path 
of obedience, turn round and round as children do, until 
I tell you to stop.” 

So poor Masseo twirled and twirled, till he fell down from 
giddiness. Then he got up and looked beseechingly at the 
saint; but the saint said nothing, and Masseo, remembering 
his vow of obedience, began again to twirl his best. He con¬ 
tinued to twirl and to fall for some time, till he seemed to 
have spent all his life in twirling, when, at last, he heard 
the welcome words: “Stop, and tell me whither your face 
is turned.” 

“To Siena,” gasped Masseo, who felt the earth rock round 
him. 

“Then to Siena we must go,” said Francis, and to Siena 
they went. 

That Francis felt the source of his troubador inspiration 
to lie in the East, and that he was connected with the Sufis, 
seems clear from much evidence. When he went to the Pope, 
trying to have his Order accepted, he used a parable which 



FRANCIS OF ASSISI 


2 59 

shows that he must have been thinking in terms of the 
orphaning of a tradition and the need to reestablish its real¬ 
ity* The phrases which he uses in the parable are of Arabia, 
and the terminology, of a King and his court, of a woman 
and her sons in the desert, is not Christian but Saracen. 

“Francis,” says Bonaventura, recording an audience with 
Pope Innocent, “came armed with a parable. There was/ 
he said, ‘a rich and mighty king who took to wife a poor 
but very beautiful woman, who lived in a desert, in whom 
he greatly delighted and by whom he had children who 
bore his image. When her sons were grown their mother 
said to them, ‘My sons, be not ashamed; ye are the children 
of a King/ And she sent them to the court, having supplied 
them with all necessaries. When they came to the King, he 
admired their beauty; and seeing in them some resemblance 
to himself, he asked them, Whose sons are ye?* When they 
replied that they were the sons of a poor woman dwelling 
in the desert, the King, filled with much joy, said, Tear not, 
ye are my sons, and if I nourish strangers at my table, how 
much more you, who are my legitimate children/ ” 

The tradition that the Sufis are the esoteric Christians 
out of the desert, and that they are the children of a poor 
woman (Hagar, wife of Abraham, because of their Arab 
descent) fits completely with the probability that Francis 
had tried to explain to the Pope that the Sufi stream repre¬ 
sented Christianity in a continuing form. 

At his first meeting with the Pope, we are told, Francis 
did not make much impression, and he was sent away. Im¬ 
mediately afterward, however, the Pope had a strange 
dream. He saw “a palm tree gradually grow up at his feet 
until it grew a goodly stature, and as he gazed upon it won¬ 
dering what the vision might mean, a divine illumination 
impressed on the mind of the Vicar of Christ that this palm 
tree signified the poor man whom he had that day driven 
from his presence.” 

The palm tree is the symbol used by the Sufis, and this 



THE SUEIS 


260 

dream is probably the consequence o£ Francis using it as an 
analogy during his audience. 1 

In die early part of the thirteenth century, Pope Inno¬ 
cent III, convinced of the validity of the saint’s mission, 
granted permission for the foundation of the Minor 
Brothers, or Franciscans. The “Lesser Brethren/’ considered 
to be a title assumed from pious humility, might lead one 
to ask whether there was any Order known as the “Greater 
Brethren.” If so, what might the connection be? 

The only people known in this way who were contem¬ 
porary with St. Francis were the Greater Brothers, an ap¬ 
pellation of the Sufi Order founded by Najmuddin Kubra, 
“the Greater.” The connection is interesting. One of the 
major characteristics about this great Sufi teacher was that 
he had an uncanny influence over animals. Pictures of him 
show him surrounded by birds. He tamed a fierce dog merely 
by looking at it—just as St. Francis is said to have cowed 
the wolf in a well-known tale. Najmuddins miracles were 
well known throughout the East sixty years before St 
Francis was born. 

When St. Francis was praised by anyone, it is reported, 
he replied with this phrase: “What every one is in the eyes 
of God, that he is no more.” 

It is related that the dictum of Najmuddin the Greater 
was: El Haqq Fahim dhsan el-Haqiqa —“The Truth it is 
which knows what is True,” 

In or about 1224, the most important and characteristic of 
all of St. Francis’ songs was composed: the Cantico del Sole 
—Song of the Sun. Jalaluddin Rumi, the Whirling Dervish 
chief and greatest poet of Persia, wrote numerous poems 
dedicated to the Sun, the Sun of Tabriz. He even called a 
collection of his poems the Collection of the Sun of Tabriz, 
In this poetry the word “sun” is used again and again. 

If it were true that St. Francis was trying to establish 
contact with the sources of his troubador poetry, we would

“Tarika.” 



FRANCIS OF ASSISI 


26l 

expect him to visit, or try to visit, the East. We would also 
expect him to be well received by the Saracens if he reached 
them. Further, he would be expected to produce Sufic 
poetry as a result of his Eastern travels. Now we can see 
whether these facts accord with history, and whether they 
were understood by his contemporaries. 

When he was thirty, Francis decided to try to reach the 
East, and specifically Syria, which abutted upon the area 
of Asia Minor where the Whirling Dervishes were estab¬ 
lished. Prevented by financial troubles, he returned to Italy. 
Then he started out again, this time toward Morocco. He 
set off with a companion and traversed the whole kingdom 
of Aragon in Spain, though nobody can say why he did 
this, and some biographers are actually puzzled. Spain was 
very much penetrated with Sufi ideas and schools. 

He did not actually reach Morocco, being driven back 
by illness. In the spring of 1214 he returned home. 

Now he set out for the Crusades, where the siege of 
Damietta was in progress. Sultan Malik el-Kamil was en¬ 
camped across the Nile—and Francis went to see him. He 
was well received, and the theory is that he went there to 
try to convert the Sultan to Christianity. "The Sultan,” says 
a chronicler, "not only dismissed Francis in peace, with 
wonder and admiration for the man's unusual qualities, but 
received him fully into his favor, gave him a safe-conduct 
by which he might go and come, with full permission to 
preach to his subjects, and an entreaty that he would fre¬ 
quently return to visit him.” 

This visit to the Saracens is assumed by biographers to be 
prompted by a desire to convert the Sultan. And yet it is 
said of him that "These two aimless journeys break in some¬ 
what strangely upon the current of his life.” They would be 
strange if they were not those of a troubador looking for 
his roots. His desire to get to Morocco is dismissed in terms 
such as these: Tt is impossible to tell what incident in his 
unrelated story may have suggested this new idea to the 
mind of Francis.” 



THE SUFIS 


262 

The Saracenic armies and the courts of their princes 
were at that time foci of Sufi activity. There can be hardly 
any doubt that it was here that Francis found what he was 
looking for. Far from having converted anyone in the 
Moslem camp, his first action upon recrossing the Nile was 
to try to dissuade the Christians from attacking the enemy. 
By the usual process of hindsight this is explained by his¬ 
torians as being due to the saint’s having had a vision of 
the forthcoming calamity to Christian arms. “His warning 
was received with contempt, as he had forseen; but in the 
month of November following was fully verified when the 
Crusaders were driven back with great loss from the walls 
of Damietta. The sympathies of Francis under such cir¬ 
cumstances must have been divided, for it is impossible that 
he could have been without some personal feeling toward 
the tolerant and friendly prince who had received him with 
such kindness.” 

The “Song of the Sun,” hailed as the first-ever Italian 
poem, was composed after the saint’s journey to the East, 
although because of his troubador background it is impos¬ 
sible for his usual biographers to believe that he was not 
composing similar poetry before this: 

It is impossible to suppose that during all these years 
[before 1224, when he wrote the “Song”] Francis, who 
was the leader of the young troubadors of Assisi in his 
early days, and who went through the woods and 
fields, after his conversion, singing to himself, still in 
French, songs which could not surely be the same songs 
he had sung through the streets among his joyous 
companions—the lays of war and love—it is impossible, 
we say, to suppose that it was for the first time at this 
late date that he had woven together canticles to the 
glory of God; but we are assured that these quaint and 
unskilled rhymes were the first beginning of vernacular 
poetry in Italy. 

The atmosphere and setting of the Franciscan Order is 


FRANCIS OF ASSISI 


263 

closer to a dervish organization than anything else. Apart 
from the tales about St. Francis which are held in common 
with Sufi teachers, all kinds of points coincide. The special 
methodology of what Francis calls “holy prayer” indicates 
an affinity with the dervish “remembering,” quite apart 
from the whirling. The dress of the Order, with its hooded 
cloak and wide sleeves, is that of the dervishes of Morocco 
and Spain. Like the Sufi teacher Attar, Francis exchanged 
his garb with a mendicant. He saw a seraph with six wings, 
an allegory used by Sufis to convey the formula of the 
bismillah . He threw away spiked crosses which were worn 
for purposes of self-mortification by many of his monks. 
This action may or may not have been exactly as it is re¬ 
ported. It may resemble the dervish practice of ceremoni¬ 
ally rejecting a cross with the words, “You may have the 
Cross, but we have the meaning of the Cross,” which is still 
in use. This, incidentally, could be the origin of the Templar 
habit, alleged by witnesses, that the Knights “trod on the 
Cross.” 

Francis refused to become a priest. Like the Sufis, he en¬ 
rolled into his teaching laymen, and again like the Sufis 
but unlike the Church, he sought to spread the movement 
among all the people, in some form of affiliation. This was 
“the first reappearance in the Church, since its full hier¬ 
archical establishment, of the democratic element—the 
Christian people, as distinguished from the simple sheep to 
be fed, and souls to be ruled.” 

The striking thing about the rules laid down by Francis 
was that, like the Sufis and unlike the ordinary Christians, 
his followers were not to think first of their own salvation. 
This principle is stressed again and again among the Sufis, 
who consider regard for personal salvation to be an expres¬ 
sion of vanity. 

He “began his preaching everywhere with the salutation 
which God, he said, had revealed to him—“The peace of God 
be with you!' ” This is, of course, an Arab salutation. 


THE SUFIS 


264 

In addition to Sufi ideas, legends and practices, St. 
Francis retained many Christian aspects in the Order. 

The consequence of this amalgam was to produce an 
organization which did not fully mature. A nineteenth- 
century commentator sums up the inevitable development: 

We who, with all the enlightenment of six additional 
centuries, can look back and see the Inquisition grimly 
shadowing from under the robes of the Spanish priest, 
and see hordes of mendicant friars, privileged and im¬ 
pudent beggars, appearing behind the genial counte¬ 
nance of Francis, may perceive how much of evil mixed 
with the good, and how the enemy of all truth had 
cunningly mixed the seed of the tares with that of the 
wheat.

V. The Secret Doctrine 


I asked a child, walking with a candle, 
“From where comes that light?” 

Instantly he blew it out. “Tell me where 
it is gone—then I will tell you where it 
came from.” 

(Hasan of Basra) 


Whether nominally of the East or West, we are all heirs in 
one way or another to the strengths and weaknesses of the 
medieval Arab philosophy. One of the drawbacks of this 
method was the attempt to apply its working outside its most 
successful field. This field was, of course, the collection, 
comparison, authentication and explanation of the tradi¬ 
tions of the Prophet. 

The adoption of this technique and its traditions, itself 
an expansion of scholarly methods derived by the Saracens 
from the Christian Greek theologians, was rapid. It could 
easily be learned, because it meant collecting facts and pil¬ 
ing them one upon the other, with a view to form some¬ 
thing complete. 

There was another factor which existed side by side with 
this system in the Saracen lands. It was the formulation of 
schools of study and practice of a special kind in which the 
teacher, the teaching and the taught formed, in at least one 
sense, a unity. This part of the method was not transmitted 
unaltered, because it did not lend itself to institutionaliza-

tion, the format which was developing most rapidly in the 
West Even before the Moors were expelled from Spain, it 
was mainly their books which were translated, and this 
"single-line" knowledge was accepted, together with mate¬ 
rial which had already filtered through from earlier eastern 
Mediterranean sources. "The can of pineapples was im¬ 
ported, and recipes concocted based on canned pineapple. 
The growing and packing of the pineapple was something 
else, which in most quarters received little attention," says 
a modem Sufi on this theme. 

Because the personal element of a teacher with special 
attainments militated against the needs of a continuing or¬ 
ganization, this concept was dropped. It lingered, uneasily, 
among the independent people who were termed occultists 
and preached a doctrine dangerous to institutionalism—the 
unacceptable one of the need for a completely qualified 
teacher, one who knew things which were not in books. 

After the fall of Constantinople, Greek original material 
—again in the form of books—provided more "single-line" 
material, more cases of pineapples. The institution of dis- 
cipleship, tied to the concept of maintaining the monastic or 
academic institution, regarded advanced products in the 
form of personalities of greatness with wonder and admira¬ 
tion. The object of the institution was not to produce such 
people. They occurred in spite of, not because of, it. They 
were labeled saints. This was the function of religious or¬ 
ganization. 

The intellectual movement, on the other hand, specialized 
in producing more intellectuals and more enlightenment 
through the use of the human brain, employed more or less 
as we would today use a machine, but regarded as almost a 
form of sanctified performance, mainly because of its com¬ 
parative novelty. 

The Saracens themselves were not guiltless of transmit¬ 
ting the purely intellectual approach, though this was with 
them generally considered to be a phase rather than a dedi¬ 
cation. 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 


267 

Strong traces of the various kinds of thinking and reac¬ 
tion are still strongly with us. There is the devout scholastic; 
the pious ecclesiastic; the pure pedant. Then there is the 
man who dislikes organization so much that he overreacts 
against it, harking back to the unlettered seer of antiquity 
in the belief that the whole of human greatness is the result 
of inspiration. The psychological and other new sciences 
follow dose behind, pointing out the inadequades of all 
the rest In many cases this has already become a monotony 
referable to arguing from a new fixed idea and partaking of 
the nature of religious dogmatism and all the rest 

Even in formalized Arab (which often meant Greek) 
philosophy, there were often saving graces—strains of inner 
teaching or emphasis which were ignored in their adoption 
by the Western scholastics of the university type. In the 
East the tradition of a master and his disdples continued, 
in spite of the overlay of sheer scholasddsm. 

It is acknowledged that the "intellectual movement ini¬ 
tiated by Ibn-Rushd [in the twdfth century] continued to 
be a living factor in European thought until the birth of 
modem experimental stience.” 1 From the eighth century, 
the Arabs had been studying and adapting Greek thought 
to their own ideas. Like the later Westerners, most of them 
worked from books alone, on the assumption that a book 
can contain the sum total of a teaching. 

Ibn Rushd asserted the thinker's right to submit every¬ 
thing, except supematuralism, to the force of reason. He 
was a doctor, a commentator on Aristotle, and an astrono¬ 
mer. He also studied music, a monograph upon which was 
published in his famous Aristotelian commentary, and 
which was taught at Paris, after being expurgated by the 
Church. This C6rdoban was known to the West as Aver- 
roes, and he exerdsed a tremendous effect upon Jewish 
thinkers. like his master, Ibn Tufail, he is said to have 
passed down a Sufic system alongside the permitted phil-

osophical one. Ibn Tufail (known to the West as Abubacer, 
after his first name, Abu Bakr) was also a physician, 
philosopher and ultimately Vizier at the Court of Granada. 
He wrote the extraordinary romance called the Story of 
Hayy ibn-Yaqzan . This, in the opinion of Western students, 
is the prototype of Robinson Crusoe; Alexander Selkirk 
merely serving as the news peg to provide topicality. It is 
based upon a story by Avicenna the Bokharan (980-1037), 
whose teaching was almost entirely philosophical. He, too, 
was a physician, philosopher and scientist. Avicenna fol¬ 
lowed yet another giant philosopher, Alfarabi (Alfarabius), 
whose Sufic ideas have been labeled Neoplatonic. He died 
over a thousand years ago. 

All these names form a vital part of the modern heritage 
of thought. The reaction against medieval attempts to form 
a coherent idea of life and creation has, in the opinion of 
many, not served us very much better than credulity. The 
questing mind of the scientist, full of the desire for discov¬ 
ery, has been recognized in more recent times as overreach¬ 
ing itself. The scientist who has to keep his mind and con¬ 
centration fixed upon an ever-narrowing field of study is 
in danger, and nowadays he admits it. He can become too 
concentrated or too diffused. His intellectual development 
is sometimes won at a sacrifice of emotional adjustment. 
This danger has long been apparent to those Sufis who were 
interested in scientific work. One of them, Anwar Faris, 
says: 

The twin exercises of identification and detachment 
are valuable in the training of the self. Too much 
identification produces an atrophy of the faculty of 
detachment. Fanaticism is the frequent result. A man 
becomes attached to something and cannot escape. 
When the Sage ibn-Sina (Avicenna) was writing his 
work on minerals, he used to study the mineral world, 
in general and in particular. He concentrated upon 
individual examples, then detached from this and ah- 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 


269 

sorbed himself in the whole. Thus did he strike a 
balance, together with concentration and detachment 
in other fields of thought and essence. 

The superficial remedy to this is expressed in the “com¬ 
plete man” which tire Moors considered to be a reflection 
of the inner complete man. Joseph McCabe (The Splendour 
of Moorish Spain , London, 1935) refers to the outer ap¬ 
pearance of the cultivated man in his Spanish setting: 

... all but a few literary cranks now see that the 
main line of human progress is in the extension of the 
scientific spirit to the whole of life. But it must be kept 
carefully in mind that this is only half of the Arab 
ideal of life. To most of their thinkers it would have 
seemed meaningless to ask if science were not in some 
danger of making men hard, calculating, overintel¬ 
lectual, cold, insensitive to beauty and art. Their 
students of science were quite commonly poets and 
musicians. That there was any antagonism between the 
intellectual and the emotional life, that both could not 
be cultivated by the same person, would have seemed 
to them a paradox. 

This way of life, still less the Sufic one, was not widely 
adopted by the newly emergent West. In the Renaissance 
the cultural ideal was attempted, but not the one within 
that, the thesis of internal change, balance, extension of 
perception. The arts, studies and theories were adopted 
piecemeal and studied or reproduced, even developed. The 
inner sense was lost, lingering in places to be derided by 
the victorious sheer scholasticism and pure art-worship. The 
materials were studied and handed on in fragments as 
philosophy, astronomy, medicine. Many developing schools 
of learning in northern Europe, under severe ecclesiastical 
pressure or control, found it necessary to expurgate from 
this material non-Christian sentiments. This further limited 
the vitality of the material. 


THE SUFIS 


270 

From Sicily, through the German "Baptized Sultans" of 
the Hohenstaufen strain, northern Europe received a form 
of this knowledge, but it was undoubtedly processed in a 
similar way. And this notwithstanding the adoption of Sufi 
architecture for the great Hohenstaufen castle, nor the 
Sufi symbolism of the coronation mantle of King Roger I. 

It is almost not too much to say that those who persisted 
in thinking Sufistically were soon branded occultists. Their 
followers accepted the label. The result was a distorted, 
rather pathetic belief, in mastership, illumination and the 
personal triumph through occultism. Roger Bacon cites the 
Secrets of lUuministic Wisdom, a Sufi book by Ibn Sabin, 
who was in correspondence with Frederick II von Hohen¬ 
staufen. (Hitti, op. ciu, pp. 587, 610.) Bacon's fate was to 
be considered as an occultist, not because of his preaching 
as officially accepted, but because of his having impressed 
the ‘living transmission" theory upon those who disliked 
dogmatism and were therefore themselves cast into the 
scholastic wilderness. Nowadays their spiritual heirs accept 
the occultist label, and wander still—like the Indian un¬ 
touchables who actually refer to themselves as outcasts. 

The West (which mostly meant the Church) had taken 
what it thought it needed, and slammed the door with what 
seemed finality. Books were burned, Spain reclaimed for 
the true faith. At the other side of the threshold were left a 
strange assortment of people, things and ideas. Among them 
was material for future puzzlement, not strange to a Sufi— 
the troubadors, the game of cards, the harlequin, certain 
initiatory societies. 

There were cracks in the door, which let something, but 
very little, in and out. 

At the end of the eighteenth century, Napoleon invaded 
Egypt. A general with his forces founded the Order of the 
Seekers of Wisdom, otherwise known as the Sufiyin—the 
Sufis. 

In a book perhaps correctly entitled the Melange, he ex¬ 
plained how he located among the Eastern Adepts the 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 


27I 

sources of the “orphan” secret wisdom of the West. “This 
was the Fount. We had been for centuries following the 
wide but muddied river.” 

Why and by what process the river had repeatedly be¬ 
come muddied in the West seems to have been eventually 
understood by the Sufiyin, who in microcosm repeated the 
fate of their predecessors-though through no fault of their 
own. They had assumed that all they needed to import into 
the West was the doctrine and the methodology, without 
the teacher. 

Only six years after the reputed date of starting the 
Order, the Affirmation of the Sophiens of France” admitted 
failure: “We must dissolve rather than continue repeti- 
tiously to practice rituals and operations which in the ab¬ 
sence of the active teaching master cannot produce the es¬ 
sential man. The process is of a complexity which only 
superior perceptions of needs will meet. The secret which 
the master has, this he uses to cause and make grow the 
change in others, who shall take his place. Without him, 
the community cannot really progress, though it may retain 
its outward form.” 

but Sufi masters cannot be recruited or imported. The 
notice of dissolution continues piteously: “Who can force 
to himself the presence of the living illuminate? He knows 
the needs, and he fulfills them. For us there is only yearn¬ 
ing.” 

At least the Sophiens had learned something. Fragments 
seem to have lingered on, because many years later an off¬ 
shoot was reported to be persisting in India. 

Was the door slammed for good? It seemed so. Not only 
did the West have enough science, art and other materials 
to digest, but it had the weapon of propaganda. The geo¬ 
political struggle so well delineated by Professor Toynbee, 2 

2 A. J. Toynbee, A Study of History , Vol. VIII: Heroic Ages-

seq., “The Encirclement of the Islamic World by the West Persia 
and Tibet.” ’

coupled with the Crusades mentality, proceeded to stigma¬ 
tize everything Saracen, “paynim” or Arab as not only 
heretical, infidel and unpleasant, but diabolical and danger¬ 
ous. The West inherits this tradition, steadily reinforced by 
events. First it was the Spanish Arabs who had to be beaten 
back from the borders of France. Then the infidel who was 
holding the Holy Land. Then the Turks were preparing 
to storm the gates of Vienna. Mohammedanism lumped to¬ 
gether in the Western mind, constituted a threat and an 
evil which must be contained and counterattacked. The last 
phase was ably sustained by the missionary interests which 
intended to overcome Islam for the greater glory of the 
Church. The existence of the Turkish Empire only proved 
that the infidel foe was still a threat. Little was to be learned, 
in any case, from people who were in many cases now mem¬ 
bers of dependent communities, whether the sun set on 
them or not 

Only cranks interested themselves in Eastern philosophy. 
Cranks were to be found in every community. Was one to 
turn Turk or go native? Unhygienic people who did not 
even accept the Gospel and whom one ruled were hardly 
likely to be able to teach anything. Let them, in any case, 
put their own house in order first. 

And yet there were people who looked beyond this tem¬ 
porary view of human development, even though they 
would never have believed that the circumstances in which 
they found themselves were as temporary as we now know 
them to be. And the process started early, earlier than one 
would believe. The Sufic current was at work. 

We must go back several hundred years, to Majorca, to 
find a trace of the double life which was being led by 
mystics at that time-Christian anchorites doubling as Sufi 
teachers. 

Brother Anselm of Turmeda was a Majorcan mystic of 
the dark ages—and saint to the Christians. But this was very 
far from being all. Among the Moslem Spaniards he was the 
sanctified Sufi Abdullah el Tarjuman. What did he teach? 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 273 

His book, Dispute of the Ass with Brother Anselmo, is a 
sometimes literal translation of a part of the Encyclopaedia 
of the Arab Brethren of Purity. Since his Arabic name 
literally means “Servant of God/' “the Translator,” there is 
no reason why he should not have tried, by translation, to 
pass on Sufi teachings. A modem Spanish scholar (Angel 
Gonzalez Palenda, in Hispania, XVIII, 3, October, 1935) 
draws attention to him and calls him el estupendo plagiario 
—but in the middle ages learning was not always considered 
to be the property of individuals; especially the knowledge 
published by a secret society, a band of anonymous sages 
like the Brethren. Copyright was unknown. 

This living link between Arab teaching and Christianity 
is carried on by another strange character, a renegade priest. 
In 1782, Father Juan Andres, an expelled Jesuit, published 
a remarkable book Origen, progresos y estado actual de toda 
la literatura. He tried to show the debt of Europe to Spanish- 
Arabian learning. He pointed to the diffusion of science, 
even recognized the debt of St Thomas to this source. 
Spanish poetry, he noted, sprang from the Arabic develop¬ 
ment in Spain, including the Provencal and troubador ro¬ 
mances and Italian lyric verse, as well as the development 
of the novel, fables and the music of the Arabic-speaking 
Alfonso the Sage. 

How did the renegade Jesuit know all these things? There 
was no documentation at the time available to him. And 
yet, in some so far unexplained manner, he discovered facts 
about the Arab—and particularly Sufic—heritage of the 
West which was later to be pieced together, almost point 
by point, largely through a study of the documents of Arab 
Spain. Even the probable origins of the Jesuit system in the 
Fatimite schools of Egypt 3 can hardly account for the per¬ 
ception which ex-Father Andres showed, because this was 
not a Sufi School. Was there a current of hidden teaching, 
a vein of ancient lore, which the expelled Jesuit had tapped?

THE SUEIS

There was, indeed The Eastern impact in the dark ages 
was absorbed on several levels. Of these the most important 
are the theological and the occultist. Lully, Assisi, Scot and 
dozens of others passed on the theological version. But we 
only have to glance at the list of the famous names of occult 
illuminati of Europe to see what was the nature of the secret 
doctrine which they were passing down, in however garbled 
a form. 

Raymond Lully, according to the occultists, was an al¬ 
chemist and illuminate. According to the devout, he was a 
Christian missionary. According to his own writings, he 
was an adapter of Sufi books and exercises. Roger Bacon, 
another hierophant of occultism, wrote on Sufi illuminism. 
Paracelsus, who tried to reform Western medicine, presents 
Sufi ideas. He, too, is one of the heroes of the “magicians” 
and alchemists. Geber the alchemist was one of the best- 
known Sufis of Iraq. He is known as a master of occultism. 
Also in the occult tradition is Albertus Magnus, both 
scholastic and magician, who studied in Arab schools and 
inspired St. Thomas Aquinas. Numerous Popes supposed to 
be magicians or transmitters of a secret doctrine, the hidden 
teaching, were graduates of Arab schools—such as Gerbert, 
Pope Silvester II, Laurence, Archbishop of Malfi, is charged 
with having learned his secret lore from Silvester. And so 
the process continues. 

In organizations it is the same story. If the Franciscan 
Order bears the stamp of Sufi origins, so do the Rosicrucians 
and the Masons. The terminology of contemporary witches 
in England contains (as “unknown words”) ordinary un¬ 
translated Arabic phrases. The salutation “Blessed Be!” is 
the least significant, but provides an instance of a direct 
rendering of the Sufi salutation Mabaruk bashad—the call¬ 
ing down of the bar aka upon an individual or assembly. 

The secret teaching, in most of its expressions accessible 
to us, therefore, boils down to very little other than simplicity 
for whoever has the patience or the general knowledge of 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 275 

what was on which side of the door when it was banged, 
all those centuries ago. 

There are times in the lives of all scholars when, with all 
the drama and excitement of discovery, the thrill of realiza¬ 
tion bursts upon them. It may be the result of a tiny thought, 
working in the mind, patiently collecting unaccounted 
scraps of information, bursting forth into blinding light. 
Inventors, scientists, historians, all have known this ex¬ 
perience. Miguel Asfn y Palacios, the renowned Spanish 
Arabist, devout Christian though he was, knew this thrill 
when he came across the work of the illuminist school of 
Sufi philosophers, and realized what they had given to the 
world—even the highest reaches of the Catholic world. 

It was in the ninth century that Ibn Masarrah of 
Cordoba taught to a select group of disciples what he knew 
of the heights to which the human consciousness could at¬ 
tain. From these beginnings the illuminists were to provide 
the substance of the allegories of Dante; the teachings of 
the school known as the Augustinian scholastics of the mid¬ 
dle ages; the wisdom of some of the founders of modern 
Western philosophy—Duns Scotus and Roger Bacon from 
Britain, Raymond Lully of Majorca, St. John of the Cross 
among the canonized. Solomon ibn Gabirol, a Jewish 
thinker of Malaga, based his Fount of Life on Masarrah's 
work. This, in turn, inspired the Franciscan School. (Hitti, 
History of the Arabs , pp. 580 et seq.) 

As he delved more and more deeply into the rare manu¬ 
scripts which had lain almost untouched in Spain since the 
expulsion of the Moors, Professor Asm's excitement 
mounted. There, in the sometimes crabbed, strange 
Maghribi script of the Sufi Spaniards of a millennium ago, 
was not only the idea of the illuministic philosophy—but 
in many cases he found literal quotations cited in the works 
of mystics and philosophers whose names were household 
words to the devout of Europe. Asin was not alone in this 
discovery, however, for Professor Ribera had noted such 
facts as the statement by the great Majorcan mystic Lully 


276 THE SUFIS 

that he had written his masterwork Book of the Lover and 
the Beloved on the pattern of the Sufis. 

All this is all the more remarkable because the Sufi il¬ 
luminists are among the most famous and yet the most 
secretive of all Sufi schools. Such intellectual giants as 
Suhrawardi, Ibn El-Arabi of Murcia and El-Ghazali rigidly 
adhered in their public writings to noncommunication of 
the vital data which was to bring about the actual trans¬ 
formation of the human mind and complete the "alchemy 
of happiness," as Ghazali called it. The strange seeming 
contradiction that gnosticism and agnosticism actually meet 
somewhere along the Sufi path baffled the externalists who 
sought to penetrate the experiences of the schools. It still 
baffles some people. 

And yet there is evidence that at the deepest levels of 
Sufic secrecy there is a mutual communication with the 
mystics of the Christian West. And the influence of the 
illuminist philosophy profoundly affected the East as well 
—the Persian, Turk, Afghan mystics all followed the il¬ 
luminists. Arkon Daraul (A History of Secret Societies, 
New York, 1962) has shown that the process of illuminism 
as the host to a secret within a secret extends until the pres¬ 
ent day. The illuminati of England, France and Germany, 
organized as a secret society, the Alumbrados of Spain and 
numerous other initiatory circles, continue to transmit the 
teachings of these Spanish scholars. 

Before turning to a consideration as to what illuminism 
is, it will be as well to note what its followers had to say 
about its origins. Here again we come across the secret- 
doctrine theory in its full development. The secret book 
Wisdom of Illumination states that the philosophy is iden¬ 
tical with the inner teachings of all the ancients—the 
Greeks, the Persians, the Egyptians—and is the science of 
Light and the deepest truth, through whose exercise man 
can attain to a status about which he can normally only 
dream. 

Roger Bacon repeated this assertion, and from him the 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 


2 77 

idea was taken up all over Europe, giving rise to nu¬ 
merous secret schools, some of them genuine, others entirely 
bogus. This knowledge, said Bacon, was known to Noah 
and Abraham, to the Chaldean and Egyptian masters, to 
Zoroaster and Hermes and Greeks such as Pythagoras, 
Anaxagoras and Socrates—and to the Sufis. Suhrawardi, 
who wrote his secret book a century before Bacon (and was 
judicially murdered for it) is quoted by Bacon himself—or 
rather his book is, as Baron Carra de Vaux has shown 
(Journal Asiatique, XIX, p. 63). 

Among the strange byways of history we may note Bacon 
named as a Rosicrudan, a follower of the path of the Rose 
Cross—a late mistranslation of the Sufi phrase “Path of the 
Rose.” 

It was inevitable that religious zealots and others should 
counterattack the Western scholars who unearthed the Sufi 
teachings as being the basis of work which had been for 
centuries admired and applauded by the most orthodox 
Christians. Hence we find Asm replying ( Ohras Escogidas, 
I, Madrid, 1946) with all the emphasis at his disposal: 

“Recently publishing a doctoral thesis —Character and 
Origins of the Ideas of the Blessed Raymond Lulle, 
(Toulouse, 1912)—its author, Mr. Probost, with completely 
infantile audacity, calls Menedez y Pelayo, Ribera and me 
liars and romantics for maintaining the Arab affiliation of 
the Lullian system. This inexpert youth does not know my 
study Psychology According to Mohiedin Abenarahi, pub¬ 
lished in the Actes du XTV me Congres des Orientcdistes 
seven years ago, in which I had demonstrated documentarily 
the copying of the allegory of the Lights.” Even in those 
days, before his studies of the illuminism of the Sufis were 
complete, Asin was ready and willing to produce docu¬ 
ments to prove his point. 

In the work of men like Asin, the pendulum is swinging 
back, and the Sufi influence is being recognized. But the 
discovery that Christian contemplatives used Sufi books, 
Sufi methods, Sufi terminology has stimulated the inevitable 



THE SUFIS 


278 

results, expressed in the explanations which are now pour¬ 
ing out from the cells of the modem scholastics. Sufism, it 
is now declared, is able to produce true mystical experience 
because the Sufis revere Jesus. Further, Sufism was pro¬ 
foundly influenced in its early days by Christianity. The 
implication is that Sufic ideas are not to be rejected. If St 
John of the Cross and Lully could use them, there must be 
some good in them. The scholastics have retraced a part of 
their path, and are rewriting their history to allow for un¬ 
comfortable facts. The only danger in this activity is that, 
as new material comes to light, new reshaping of the official 
attitude becomes necessary. Mental gymnastics. Those who 
do not adhere so strongly to the theological line are busy 
tracing Sufism back to “coincidences” in ancient doctrines. 

Contact with Sufis, who were discovered not to be ogres 
after all, provoked another interesting development in 
Western thought, a process which is still continuing. This 
development can best be termed recognition. A realization 
of the affinity of Sufic thought with Western intuition and 
ideas has brought many people to the point where they are 
taking a close look at the system. By Sufic thinking this 
comes about for two reasons—firstly because the bases of 
Sufi ways are inherent in the human mind (“there is only 
one Right Way”) and again because in modem Western 
training of all kinds are the scattered seeds of the ideas of 
the Sufi transmitters from Spain, Sicily and elsewhere. The 
Sufic sentiments of Khayyam and others, which have almost 
become naturalized into the West, is another source of the 
diffusion of this current. We have various aspects of this 
diffusion in this book, chosen in order to illustrate it, not as 
any complete enunciation. 

The teachings of a continued vein of secret teaching, of 
which the books of philosophers were merely a part without 
the key, the arguments without the action, was transmitted 
to the West from the illuminist Sufis of Spain, and possibly 
the Near East as well. One channel is known to us—from 
Andalusia the dissemination of this idea has been traced 



THE SECRET DOCTRINE 279 

by Asfn and his associates to Roger Bacon and Raymond 
Lully. Others have followed the trail in the work of 
Alexander Hales and Duns Scotus, and have noted the 
determining influence upon the so-called Augustinian 
scholastics of the West. 

The traditional account of how the teachings are trans¬ 
mitted and from where is partially contained in the 
Wisdom of Illumination, written by the martyr Suhrawardi. 
He lived from 1154 t° II 9 I &gt; an Easterner domiciled in 
Aleppo, and was killed by the order of the orthodox, whose 
pressure Saladin’s nephew, the local ruler, was unable to 
resist Thus he is known as “Suhrawardi the Murdered." 
He is one of the greatest Sufi teachers; and his school, as 
Asin has demonstrated, provided Dante with his ideas. The 
“Murdered Sheikh" did not originate the illuministic theory 
of Sufism, nor the tradition of a chain of masters from the 
remotest antiquity. But in the preface to his book we have a 
sketch of his teachings on this point. Most copies were com¬ 
mitted to the flames, but some have survived, especially in 
the East. 

As with most Sufi books, this was written in response to 
repeated requests, as he observes—written for his friends 
and companions. Philosophy has always existed, and there 
has always been a true philosopher in the world. The dif¬ 
ferences between the ancients and modems is one of proof 
and demonstration. Aristotle was a great teacher, but de¬ 
pendent upon his forerunners. Among these were Hermes, 
Aesculapius and others, in very long succession. They may 
be divided into classes, some more elevated than others, ac¬ 
cording to the balance between intellection, speculation, 
belief and so on. The importance of the philosopher is so 
great that if a fully balanced one is found, he is the repre¬ 
sentative of God on earth. But the inner philosopher is al¬ 
ways superior to the scholastic. There is never an age in 
which a great theosopher is not in existence. The specula¬ 
tive philosopher has no right or claim to mlership. This 
rulership may not be political power; but if wisdom and 



THE SUEIS 


280 

power of a material sort are combined, the age is illuminated. 
Yet the philosopher may, because of his endowments, re¬ 
main unknown and yet have the mastery of the world. 

It is best for the philosopher to combine insight with ex¬ 
perience, rather than one or the other. Nobody can benefit 
from a study of Sufism unless he has freed himself from the 
mental habits of formal philosophy. Such an undeveloped 
person should only frequent ordinary philosophers. In 
Sufism certain perceptions have to be developed and further 
development depends upon these. This is the equivalent of 
the scholastic method in which the experiences are formed 
and ideas built of ideas. Unless this method of the Sufis is 
followed, the practitioner cannot be considered a real 
philosopher. 

The ancient doctrines of Egypt and Greece are in direct 
line with Sufism, and with them, of course, exposition had 
to take its place and relationship to experience, which 
means the development of the Sufi perceptions. The termi¬ 
nology of the illuminists indicates that the theory embraces 
the ancient wisdom of the Semites as well as that of the 
Persians, hence showing the theme of the essential unity 
of “complete” philosophy at the theory and practice level. 

In formal scholasticism, of course, the division between 
intellect and inspiration is so great that it is difficult at first 
for the uninformed reader to grasp that these two things 
are considered by this school to be inseparable if the truth 
is to be reached. Hence the Sufi insistence that this step of 
cognition must be made. 


The Higher Law 


There are three indications o£ real 
generosity: to remain steadfast without 
resisting, to praise without the emotion of 
generosity, and to give before being asked. 

(Maaruf Karkhi) 


One of the most interesting productions of Western Sufic 
literature is the long poem The Kasidah, written a century 
ago by the explorer Sir Richard Burton, himself a Sufi, and 
composed on his return journey from Mecca. This “Lay of 
the Higher Law,” which appeared in small editions, aroused 
a great deal of interest. Even Lady Burton, who was not 
oversympathetic to her husband's heterodox beliefs, con¬ 
fessed that she had read it many times, and “never without 
bitter tears, and when I read it now it affects me still more; 
he used to take it away from me because it impressed me 
so. There is no doubt that the poem is a powerful composi¬ 
tion, steeped in Sufi lore. 

Burton, in his foreword to The Kasidah, called himself 
the translator,” and attributed the work to one Haji Abdu 
al-Yazdi. He summarizes it thus: 

The principles which justify the name, Higher Law, 
are as follows: 

The Author asserts that Happiness and Misery are 
equally divided and distributed in the world. 


THE SUFIS 


282 

“He makes Self-cultivation, with due regard to 
others, the sole and sufficient object of human life. 

“He suggests that the affections, the sympathies and 
the 'divine gift of Pity are man's highest enjoyments. 

“He advocates suspension of judgment, with a proper 
suspicion of Tacts, the idlest of superstitions.' 

“Finally, although destructive to appearance, he is es¬ 
sentially reconstructive." 

“Only an admirer of Omar Khayyam could have written 
The Kasidah says Justin Huntly McCarthy. And yet, ac¬ 
cording to Lady Burton, the poem was written eight years 
before FitzGerald introduced Burton, Swinburne and 
Rosetti to Omar. What the two poets have in common, of 
course, is that they are both Sufis. 

Although only a few hundred copies appeared, The 
Kasidah (“The Tinkling of the Camel Bell") was included 
in Lady Burton's biography of “the greatest Oriental scholar 
England ever had and neglected." As a result, the work be¬ 
came very widely known, and its hidden influence upon 
those who studied it must have been great. Summing it up, 
Isabel Burton shows how the outlines of Sufic thinking can 
influence even one who is devoutly Christian and unsym¬ 
pathetic to the author's commitment: “It is a poem of ex¬ 
traordinary power, on the Nature and Destiny of Man, 
anti-Christian and Pantheistic. So much wealth of Oriental 
learning has rarely been compressed into so small a com¬ 
pass." 

What Burton has done has been to comment in verse 
upon Western methods of thought, modern theories and 
philosophies, from the Sufi point of view. More, he has 
(like Khayyam) taken it upon himself to ask questions to 
which he does not supply fixed answers. This is the tech¬ 
nique of the teaching Sufi who poses questions and waits 
to see whether his hearers will seek the explanation or not. 
The Sufi message had something for Western thinkers, and 
was even recognized as the essence of Burton's life. Burton s 


THE HIGHER LAW 


283 

Life was described thus by one enthusiast: “to me its great 
raison d’etre / is that Tinkling of the Camel Bell . It is hard 
to judge of a thing in the first heat of admiration, but it 
seems to me worthy to stand level with the greatest poems 
of the Earth, and in front of most.” 

It is a long poem, in twenty pages of type, and an author's 
commentary upon the supposed Haji upon whom he fathered 
it is even longer. Burton follows in his notes the method of 
Sufi teachers, and this is the part of the work which most 
clearly shows that he has been through a course of Sufic 
study under a master. There seems little doubt that Burton 
was trying to project Sufi teaching in the West. To this ex¬ 
tent he must be considered a part of the process which has 
been continuous—the interchange between the East and 
West which is studied in this book. 

In Sufism he finds a system of application to misguided 
human faiths “which will prove them all right, and all 
wrong; which will reconcile their differences; will unite 
past creeds; will account for the present, and will anticipate 
the future with a continuous and uninterrupted develop¬ 
ment.” This is to be by a process “not negative and distinc¬ 
tive, but, on the contrary, intensely positive and con¬ 
structive.” Like all Sufis, he often uses the method of 
approaching his subject from a number of different angles 
—and then breaking away, leaving the reader to complete 
the process. The reason for this is that a Sufi is only made 
by passing through both discipleship and self-work (ama- 
linafs ). 

Above all. Burton, writing in a time when science and 
reason were in the full flow of their ecstatic self-discovery, 
insists that “there are things which human Reason or In¬ 
stinct matured, in its undeveloped state, cannot master; but 
Reason is a law to itself. Therefore we are not bound to 
believe, or to attempt belief in, anything which is contrary 
or contradictory to Reason.” 


THE SUFIS 


284 

The Kasidah opens with the desert, the dark, the pilgrims 
on their way to Mecca: 

The hour is nigh; the waning Queen walks forth to rule 
the later night; 

Crown'd with the sparkle of a Star, and throned on orb 
of ashen light: 

The night passes, while the travelers experience various 
emotions, and Burton takes leave of the pilgrim caravan, 
the undeveloped human continuity. He is following another 
road, a Sufi way: 

Friends of my youth, at last adieu! haply some day we 
meet again; 

Yet ne'er the self-same men shall meet; the years shall 
make us other men;. 

Go, vanish from my Life as dies the tinkling of the 
Camel's bell. 

Now the poem speaks of the endless questions which 
mankind asks, the dreadful fears which beset him. He 
quotes the Sufis Hafiz (the “Bard of Love and Wine ) and 
Khayyam, who “would divorce old barren Reason from his 
bed, / And wed the Vine-maid in her stead.” Taldng his 
questioning a stage further in typical Sufi style, he shows 
that there is something still deeper beyond their imagery: 

. . fools who believe a word he said!” He quotes the Sufi 
who says that anyone who knows that he has a soul is en¬ 
titled to ask questions about it; and he shows that the seem¬ 
ing pessimism of the Sufi at times hides something else 
exposing the absurdity of selfishness: 

And this is all, for this we're born to weep a little and 
to die! 

So sings the shallow bard whose life still labors at the 
letter “I.” 

The Sufi insistence carries Burton on to Jesus. He be¬ 
wailed our sorrows and our sin; why was a little glimpse of 
paradise not offered to man? Why could ears never hear and 



THE HIGHER LAW 285 

eyes never see bliss in the heavenly kingdom? Mansur, the 
Sufi martyr who was publicly disembodied by the forces 
of tyranny, is now put into juxtaposition with Jesus, and 
quoted: “I am the truth! I am the truth. . . . The micro¬ 
cosm abides in ME.” Mansur was wise, “but wiser they who 
smote him with the hurled stones.” 

To eat, drink and make merry is something wdiich may 
sound all very well, but it does not show any distinction 
between man and swine. The ascetic, fanatic that he is, 
answers Burton, as he stalks the earth, that he is com¬ 
pletely confident in a life to come, adjusted to his vale of 
tears. Wiser is he than Moses (who ignored future rewards 
and punishments), who shows the future state—the future 
when he does not know the past, and to whom the present 
is a mere dream. Our Sufi does not like him at all: 

What know st thou, man, of Life? and yet, for ever 
twixt the womb, the grave, 

Thou pratest of the Coming Life, of Heav'n and Hell 
thou fain must rave. 

The feeling of one's own importance, while according to 
the Sufi it may be necessary in some ways, has to be moved 
into correct perspective, otherwise the human being be¬ 
comes useless—though he may not seem so to other useless 
people. 

The world is old and thou art young; the world is large 
and thou art small; 

Cease, atom of a moment's span, to hold thyself an All¬ 
in-All! 

The section which follows this admonition studies the 
contradictions of human speculation about life, and espe¬ 
cially the theme of sorrow which runs through it. Illustra¬ 
tions are taken from Hinduism, Buddhism, the ancient 
Egyptians; the creator is seen as an enlarged human being, 
a potter, weaver, playing with what is only human senti- 


THE SUEIS 


286 

ment. The way in which diety works or seems to “plan” is 
not explicable in human terms: 

Cease, Man, to mourn, to weep, to wail; enjoy the 
shining hour of sun; 

We dance along Death's icy brink, but is the dance less 
ftdl of fun? 

Selecting sayings from ancient teachers, the English Sufi 
shows that the mere experience of life teaches nothing. 
Buddha and Confucius are quoted, and the manmade God 
is again attacked. Now the lowly ascetic, the religionist who 
merely affirms that he chooses to call the “Maker” God is 
assailed by the Sufi Drawer of the Wine. A changeful, finite 
creature cannot fathom the infinite depths of Power with 
“a foot of twine.” The Sufic echo is treading close to the 
agnosticism of which the Sufis have sometimes been ac¬ 
cused. It is only here, in this narrow strip between faith 
and disbelief, that the truth is to be found. 

The childish fears of lost humanity seek a sure God, make 
him in their own image, then “pray the Law its laws to 
break.” In one form or another we find the gloomy Brahman 
in India, the Chaldean star-oracle, the Zoroastrian dualist, 
the Jewish Jehovah—“Adon or Elohim, the God that smites, 
the Man of War.” He sweeps past the gods of Greece, fair 
and frail humanities, to the Odin of the North. Looking at 
religion as a developing human movement. Burton watches 
the death of Great Pan; the Nazarene comes and seizes his 
seat beneath the sun: “the votary of the riddle-god, whose 
one is three and three is one .” 1 And, of course, the miserable 
creed of inherited sin. 

After Christianity, Islam. The lank Arab, a lizardeater, 
overwhelms the lands of the grail of Jamshid, the Persians 
idyllic traditions of old are gone. These are the ways of 
organized religions: “they rose, they reigned, they fought, 

iThe "riddle" refers to the Sufi use of three-letter roots. The 
"three is one" stands for the three letters AHD, together spelling the 
word "unity." 



THE HIGHER LAW 287 

and fell, / as swells and swoons across the world the tinkling 
of the Camel's bell." 

There is no good, no bad, as it is measured by ordinary 
standards. This Burton affirms, without the usual Sufic rider 
that just what this means is experienced only in the Sufi's 
inner consciousness. As soon as it is expressed in the limited 
frame of words, it sounds destructive. But he is writing in 
the grip of Sufic exhilaration and he is now addressing him¬ 
self to Sufis alone. Good, he points out, is to man what he 
likes; evil what does him harm. These ideas change with 
location, with race and time. Every vice has been a virtue, 
every good has been called a sin or crime. 

Good and evil intertwine. Only Khizr (the completed 
Sufi) can see where one begins and the other ends. 

The literalist, who claims that man's early state was the 
ideal one, is now brought under heavy fire; Burton takes 
his ammunition from the modern knowledge of evolution. 
Before man walked the earth, torture and suffering were the 
continuous tone. Primitive animals tore each other apart. 
Before that, the fair earth was alternately burning hot and 
frozen solid; the sun an orb of whirling fire; the moon a 
mere corpse of what had been a world. Early man was any¬ 
thing but refined: 

His choicest garb a shaggy fell, his choicest tool a flake 
of stone; 

His best of ornaments tattoo'd skin and holes to hang 
his bits of bone; 

Who fought for female as for food when May awoke a 
warm desire; 

And such the Lust that grew to Love when Fancy lent 
a purer fire. 

This primitive man learned from beavers and ants how to 
build; and it was when he mastered fire that the lord of 
beasts became a lord of men. “Conscience was born when 
man had shed his fur, his tail, his pointed ears." 

The heritage of animality is still in man, and it is to be 


288 


THE SOTIS 


seen in the behavior of one toward another. In defiance 
of his known history, mankind cannot accept an explana¬ 
tion of hims elf based upon literal belief in tales and fables. 

Then, if tradition is not true, what is truth? What we 
think is truth is not such at all. This kind of truth is tem¬ 
peramental, changing. Burton explains this in his com¬ 
mentary upon "Haji's" poem: 'The perceptions, when they 
perceive truly, convey objective truth, which is universal; 
whereas the reflectives and the sentiments, the working of 
the moral region, or the middle lobe of the phrenologists, 
supply only subjective truth, personal and individual." 

Objective truth is the goal of the Sufi, and it is obviously 
toward the need for finding this that Burton is directing 
his audience. 

All mere theories, repetitious observances, are nothing. 
Burton now shouts at the priest to baptize the dead, as the 
Marcionites did, following a quotation from Paul (i Cor. 
XV, 29)2 "Else what shall they do which are baptized for 
the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why are they then 
baptized for the dead?" 

Truth cannot be found by the means which are generally 
used to seek it: 

Yes, Truth may be, but ’tis not Here; mankind must 
seek and find it There. 

But Where not I nor you can tell, nor aught earth- 
mother ever bare. 

The struggle to find truth comes partly, in its real form, 
through not struggling at all. This is the Sufi paradox which 
is contained in the next lines: 

Enough to th vnk that Truth can be; come sit we where 
the roses glow; 

Indeed he knows not how to know who knows not also 
how to unknow. 

Even the meaning of faith itself has to be approached 
by the Sufi in what seems to the ordinary person an el- 



THE HIGHER LAW 289 

liptical manner. Like the masters before him, Burton ap¬ 
proaches this by seeming paradox. All faith, he says, is both 
false and true, “Truth is the shattered mirror strown in 
myraid bits; / while each believes his little bit the whole to 
own.” The kind of faith which unregenerate man takes 
for real faith is so often unmoved and fixed because it is 
merely what today would be called a conditioning. This 
false faith stands, and why? Because man’s silly fancies 
still remain, / And will remain till wiser man the daydreams 
of his youth disdain.” This is precisely the thought of Rumi, 
when he asks when the hearer will stop coveting the sweets 
of childhood. 

Now into the discussion. After Burton dismisses the con¬ 
ventional teaching on the soul, the zealot strikes back with 
a harsh condemnation of materialism, which is what he 
thinks the Sufi is advocating: 

"Tush!” quoth the Zahid [devotee], “well we ken the 
teaching of the school abhorr’d 

That maketh man automaton, mind a secretion, soul 
a word.” 

Burton spares him little time. Faith is due to an accident 
of birth; the faith that men normally know is a product of 
their environment. The author again pits one religionist 
against another; the Hindu despising the Frank; the Moslem 
crying about polytheism; the Buddhist calling the Con- 
fudan a dog; the Tartar claiming that attention to a future 
state is betraying the effidency and duties of man in the 
world. And the Sufi chimes in: 

“You all are right, you all are wrong,” we hear the 
careless Sufi say, 

Tor each believes his glimm’ring lamp to be the gor¬ 
geous light of day.” 

Man’s ignorance of his own ignorance is the real enemy. 
He must seek truth in the right way, must gladden the 
heart, . . . abjure the Why and seek the How.” 



THE SUEIS 


290 

Looking to the future, because he finds no response in 
the people of his own time, Burton tells himself that, having 
delivered his message, in days to come when wisdom dwells 
with men, "These echoes of a voice long stilled haply shall 
wake responsive strain.” 

Wend now thy way with brow serene, fear not thy 
humble tale to tell: 

The whispers of the Desert-wind; the tinkling of the 
Gamers bell. 

Burton's burst of Sufi activity in The Kasidah, published 
sixty years ago, was paralleled by Wilberforce Clarke's 
translation and adaptation of the Gifts. This cleared a great 
deal of ground in showing that the dervish philosophy was 
different from normal Western assessment of it at the time. 
This supplied at least a basis for the further examination 
of Sufic ideas, if not practices. Burton, by relating Sufi 
thought to modem Western feelings, provided a bridge 
whereby the thinking Westerner could accept essential 
Sufi concepts. It remained for Cartwright to leave an 
equally important book, one which in the guise of pseudo- 
Oriental romance presented some of the actual experiences 
of being a Sufi. 

Since the complete work-and-thought system of Sufism has 
not been much used in the West, and because of prejudice 
or a difference of thought, until recently seemed unlikely 
to "naturalize” itself where it was needed most, it is to be 
ejected that few original literary works of a Sufi nature 
would be found in Western European languages. The text¬ 
books in the East are generally couched in poetic or de¬ 
votional terms, and the active part of the teaching is sup¬ 
plied by a master whose major function is actually to be a 
master, to exist among his students. Cartwright did the next 
best thing: he wrote an account of his experiences in such 
a school. 

The Mystic Rose from the Garden of the King first ap¬ 
peared in 1899. Superficially the book looks like a fantasy. 



THE HIGHER TAW 291 

Its author was Sir Fairfax L. Cartwright, a member of the 
diplomatic service. The book was reprinted in 1925, and 
it contains two important sources of Sufi experience for 
those who can understand it. The portion devoted to stories 
is designed to lift momentarily the veil between ordinary 
thought and the inner questioning of the mind. The other 
portion gives a series of inner experiences, which are num¬ 
bered and which represent one person's varied realization 
of the extra element possible to man's attainment before he 
comes to the point where he can make use of this percep¬ 
tion. 

Like Burton, Sir Fairfax found it necessary to attribute in 
the first edition the authorship to an Oriental—'“Sheikh Haji 
Ibrahim of Kerbela.” He uses the Eastern imagery and set¬ 
ting because it does lend itself to the projection of Sufi 
thought through the objectivization of the content. Like 
the fable with which this book begins, it enables the 
reader to detach himself from associations, and to partici¬ 
pate to some extent in the reality which the author is trying 
to convey. The reader does not really think of himself as a 
dervish or Oriental king. To this extent he can safely enter¬ 
tain ideas in theory and even more that he would reject if 
they were presented within his own culture pattern. 

This book is no substitute for Sufi experience, but it con¬ 
tains material well suited to the Western mind trying to 
grasp a mode of thought which in its culture lacks many 
agreed bases. The idea that ecstatic experience is Sufism or 
really mysticism of any land is one of the numerous points 
scotched by Cartwright: 

"The man who is despondent seeks consolation in intoxi¬ 
cation, but intoxication may be produced by good wine or 
by bad wine; the good wine will raise him into a state of 
material ecstasy and make him forget his despondency; the 
bad wine will make his state worse than it was before. So 
it is with the spiritual wine; if it be pure it will lift the 
disciple who drinks thereof into the realm of the perfect 
contemplation of the truth, but if it be adulterated and 


292 THE SUFIS 

impure it will throw his soul back even further than the 
point which it has already attained/' 

The allegory of alchemy, a traditional Sufi tale in which 
the great work of transmutation is accomplished, is given a 
fresh form in the book. The book is full of allegories, and 
one of the best is a Western adaptation of the ‘Tale of the 
Sands," which loses nothing in the form which he gives it: 

A bubbling stream reached a desert, and found that it 
could not cross it. The water was disappearing into the fine 
sand, faster and faster. The Stream said aloud, “My destiny 
is to cross this desert, but I can see no way." 

This is the situation of the disciple who needs a master, 
but who cannot trust one, the pathetic human situation. 

The voice of the Desert answered, in the hidden tongue 
of nature, saying, “The Wind crosses the desert, and so can 
you." 

“But, whenever I try, I am absorbed into the sand; and 
even if I dash myself at the desert, I can only go a little 
distance." 

‘The Wind does not dash itself against the desert sand." 

“But the Wind can fly, and I cannot.” 

“You are thinking in the wrong way; trying to fly by 
yourself is absurd. Allow the Wind to carry you over the 
sand." 

“But how can that happen?” 

“Allow yourself to be absorbed in the Wind." 

The Stream protested that it did not want to lose its in¬ 
dividuality in that way. If it did, it might not exist again. 

This, said the Sand, was a form of logic, but it did not 
refer to reality at all. When the Wind absorbed moisture, it 
carried it over the desert, and then let it fall again like 
rain. The rain again became a river. 

But how, asked the Stream, could it know that this was 

true? 

“It is so, and you must believe it, or you will simply be 
sucked down by the sands to form, after several million 
years, a quagmire.” 



THE HIGHER LAW 


293 

“But if that is so, will I be the same river that I am today?" 

“You cannot in any case remain the same stream that 
you are today. The choice is not open to you; it only seems 
to be open. The Wind will carry your essence, the finer part 
of you. When you become a river again at the mountains 
beyond the sands, men may call you by a different name; 
but you yourself, essentially, will know that you are the 
same. Today you call yourself such and such a river only 
because you do not know which part of it is even now your 
essence." 

So the Stream crossed the desert by raising itself into the 
arms of the welcoming Wind, which gathered it slowly and 
carefully upward, and then let it down with gentle firm¬ 
ness, atop the mountains of a far-off land. “Now," said the 
Stream, T have learned my true identity." 

But it had a question, which it bubbled up as it sped 
along: r&lt; Why could I not reason this out on my own; why 
did the Sands have to tell me? What would have happened 
if I had not listened to the Sands?" 

Suddenly a small voice spoke to the Stream. It came from 
a grain of sand. “Only the Sands know, for they have seen 
it happen; moreover, they extend from the river to the 
mountain. They form the link, and they have their function 
to perform, as has everything. The way in which the 
stream of life is to carry itself on its journey is written in 
the Sands." 



The Book of the Dervishes 


If you know not these states, pass 
on, nor join the infidel in ignorant 
counterfeit . . . but all learn not the secrets 
of the Way. 

(Shabistari, Secret Garden, Johnson Pasha's 
version) 


If there is any standard dervish textbook it is the "Gifts of 
(Deep) Knowledge”—the Awarif el-Maarif —'written in the 
thirteenth century and studied by members of all Orders. 
Its author, Sheikh Shahabudin Suhrawardi (1145-c. 1235) 
presided over the coalescing of theory, ritual and practice 
which took place in his time, established teaching schools 
dose to the courts of Persia and India, and was Chief of the 
Chiefs of Sufis in Baghdad. 

The book is of interest to us both because it shows the 
outward and early stages of attraction into the dervish 
corpus, because it contains the basic contents of thought 
and action of these mystics, and because of Lieutenant 
Colonel Wilberforce Clarke. Colonel Clarke was himself a 
dervish, probably of the Suhrawardi Order. He translated 
more than half of the Gifts, for the first time, into English, 
and published it in 1891. Also the first English translator of 
Hafiz* Orchard, Nizami's Story of Alexander, and Hafiz* 
Works , he was a worthy follower of the tradition of dis¬ 
tinguished Sufic adapters such as Raymond Lully. ; 



THE BOOK OE THE DERVISHES 295 

Taken as a whole, Clarke's work can be seen as an at¬ 
tempt to present dervish thinking to an English audience 
which was thinking of the dervish as an insane, blood¬ 
stained fanatic. Dervishes there were, in the Sudan. They 
were taken to be some kind of savage. Others were known 
in Turkey—but Turkey was rather beyond the pale, of 
course. Clarke brought the original text more up to date 
with quotations from Sir William Jones, Malcolm, the 
Secret Garden of Shabistari, Brown's Darvishes and other 
available material. He pointed out that the great Hafiz had 
been "mistranslated and misunderstood” by the poet Emer¬ 
son and others. He did not shrink from printing parallel 
extracts showing mistranslation, to the advantage of the 
dervish, not for his own academic reputation. 

Clarke attains a great deal of lucidity by rearranging the 
materials with which he is working in such a way as to 
reflect, with added information to make the picture intel¬ 
ligible to the English reader, the working of Sufism as a 
semiorganized activity within the religious context of Islam. 
It is difficult to see how this could have been better done, 
given the prevailing need in Britain for religious matters to 
be presented in a way analogous to the current brand of 
Protestant practice. This book is now nearly impossible to 
obtain. 

Islam, he noted, forbids monastidsm. The people who 
were later known as dervishes took, in the year 623, an 
oath of fraternity and fidelity in Arabia. They chose the 
name of Sufi, which stands for wool Qsuf'), pious Qsufty) 
and other meanings. These were the nucleus of the Moslem 
Sufis, the original forty-five contracting individuals of 
Mecca, together with an equal number from Medina. 

The practice of these people was given expression in var¬ 
ious ways. The First Caliph and the Fourth (Abu Bakr 
and Ali) formed spedal assemblies at which exerdses were 
held. These schools were paralleled by Uways, the founder 
of the first austere Order, in 657. Buildings were first 
dedicated to the movement's use in Syria in the eighth 



296 the sueis 

Christian century. Thus far the overt expressions of Islamic 
Sufism. 

The parallel Sufic lore which sees Sufism as a continuum, 
Clarke records, uses the “wine” allegory to show the gradual 
development of the teaching until it became a more or less 
public manifestation, before retreating again within itself 
in the seventeenth century. This is expressed thus: 

The seed of Sufism 

was sown in the time of Adam 

germed in the time of Noah 

budded in the time of Abraham 

began to develop in the time of Moses 

reached maturity in the time of Jesus 

produced pure wine in the time of Mohammed. 

Quoting attacks made on Sufis for “voluptuous libertin¬ 
ism” and for being derived from external systems, the 
Colonel affirms its essential unity and individuality. It is 
not, he says, introduced from Greece or India. He explains 
the meaning of the dervish claim, “Neither fear we hell, 
nor desire we heaven,” which sounds so strange from the 
mouth of one whom every external assessment identifies as 
a religious man. 

He is well aware of the Sufi experience that at every 
stage of development a new mystery or change in perception 
and understanding is involved. “Traces of Sufi doctrine,” he 
says, very bravely for his time, “exist in every country—in 
the theories of ancient Greece; in the modem philosophies 
of Europe; in the dream of the ignorant and of the learned; 
in the shade of ease and the hardship of the desert” 

But enlightenment can come only through the rarest of 
all men, no matter how frequent a patchy illusion of truth 
may break through the Seeker's confusion. This teacher is 
the Perfect and Excellent Guide: 'When he exists, to dis¬ 
cover him is impossible.” The teacher discovers the disciple, 
not the other way about. “False teachers and deceived Seek- 



THE BOOK OF THE DERVISHES 297 

ers vainly pursue the desert vapor—and wearied return, the 
dupe of their own imagination.” 

The problem of the would-be Sufi is in recognizing his 
teacher, because he is not yet sufficiently refined to know 
who he may be. "Perfection who shall discover save he 
who is perfect? The jewel's price who shall tell, save the 
jeweler?” Hence the disarray into which some repetitious 
dervish systems have fallen, as have other bodies of doctrine. 
Clarke quotes Mohammed: "By pious fools my back hath 
been broken.” 

The desire of the teacher is that the real desire of the 
disciple be fulfilled; that his base qualities be transmuted 
into laudable ones; that understanding come to him. 

Because it is necessary to use certain methods of over¬ 
coming undesirable mental states, the dervish described by 
Clarke must never shun temptation in the sense of fleeing 
from evil just to avoid it. He uses the externals of religion, 
and seeks to soak himself in its lore, as an insurance against 
losing his way. At the same time he knows that "Paradise, 
hell, all the dogmas of religion are allegories—the spirit 
whereof he alone knows.” This he terms the creed of the 
"men of heart, the inward people.” Evil, for them, exists 
only as not-being. Being itself, if attained completely, re¬ 
moves the possibility of the negation, so-called evil. 

By divine illumination, man sees the world to be illusion 
(in the sense that there is a greater reality of which the 
world is a gross distortion), and hence he calls the world 
evil. He tries to shake off not-being, in the Sufi phrase 
used by Clarke. 

It is not possible to understand Sufi poetry unless one is 
steeped in the imagery and almost unbelievable depth of 
feeling which is cloaked in allegory. Clarke's book now gives 
some of the technical terms which have been explained in 
the Secret Garden for the guidance of the would-be Seeker. 
Cleverly selecting points which would be most difficult for 
Western readers, Clarke explains the use of the wine 
allegory* Ecstasy and rapture, for instance, are not the states 



THE SUEIS 


298 

necessarily referred to when drunkenness is mentioned by 
Sufis. Because the intellect is dulled by alcohol, the Sufi 
state, hostile to superficial logic, is seen as a development 
consequent upon the paralysis of what most people regard 
as thought. To the Sufi the automatic thought-processes 
(the associative functions) are useful only in the fields in 
which they work—scholasticism, mechanical thinking. 

The self-righteousness which was such a marked feature 
of much Victorian thinking is a target for Clarke, and he 
selects Sufic matter whose emphases would be meaningful 
in his time. This concentration upon self, or what one as¬ 
sumes to be oneself, is the Veil of Light. The Veil of Dark¬ 
ness is the state of mind of the evil man who knows he is 
evil. Freed from this kind of self is the “tavern haunter,” 
the dervish. He is neither a believer nor an infidel, in any of 
the meanings of the word perceptible to the intellect or 
familiar emotion. 

This admirable recension of essential parts of the Gifts 
begins in substance with the character of the Sheikh—the 
Guide of the dervish. As far as the disciple is concerned, his 
first real step in his new life is the finding of such a person. 
The function of this director is to remove the rust, in the 
Sufi phrase, from the mind, so that eternal (objective) fact 
may be accessible to him. In a manner which adequately 
anticipates modem psychology, the Gifts early stresses the 
need for the Guide to be free from subjective reasons for 
seeking leadership. He must not seek precedence, being a 
Guide, or have a desire to be followed. The true leader will 
delay accepting applicants as disciples until he is sure that 
he has no such subjectivity. 

The Guide must be able to determine the capacity of the 
disciple. He will have to deal with this disciple in accord¬ 
ance with his potentiality. If there is little promise, he will 
have to use severe methods, such as admonishment. He 
orders him to follow certain attitudes of mind in order to 
change his unbalanced concentration upon certain things. 



THE BOOK OP THE DERVISHES 299 

Unless he has this perception, the Sheikh cannot be a Guide 
at all. 

The Guide must have no desire for, nor part in, any of 
the property of the disciple. He can only accept material 
things from a disciple when he is impelled to use them for 
the common good. When a disciple wants to bestow his 
property on the Sheikh, the dervish teacher may take it, be¬ 
cause he is able to exchange it for the tranquillity which 
the disciple needs. But if the disciple is still attached to 
property, he will be allowed to spend some. 

The encouragement of the sincerity of the disciple is one 
of the major concerns of the Sheikh; as also the severing of 
undesirable attachments of mind. An important part of 
this activity is charity and distribution of material substance. 
The disciple should choose poverty rather than riches, 
though to the Sufi, poverty and riches are as one. 

The Sheikh has to extend kindness and compassion. He 
abridges the austerities of the disciple as far as is possible 
within the needs of the work Too strong privations may 
prevent the disciple from integrating himself with the der¬ 
vish effort at first. 

The effect upon the disciple of what the Sheikh says is a 
most important one. It is likened to a seed, and only from 
good seed can a good crop be raised. Pollution in the mind 
of the learner can stem from the Sheikh having a desire 
to influence the hearer, or any pride in himself. The Sheikh 
does not talk to a disciple without an objective reason. "Ob¬ 
jective speech is when it means the same to the speaker as to 
the hearer." 

Advice is given to disciples in a disguised or allegorical 
form, especially when it is a criticism. 

The inner development of the disciple is something which 
the Guide keeps secret. Expectation of developments on the 
part of the former is undesirable, and the Sheikh will ex¬ 
plain that anticipation of certain states of mind will close 
the road to them. 



THE SUFIS 


300 

The disciple must honor the Sheikh deeply. Therein lies 
his hope. But, conversely, the Sheikh must not expect to be 
honored by the disciple. The rights of the disciple are al¬ 
ways respected by the Sheikh. 

The teaching Sheikh does not spend much of his time 
in association with the community. He allots times for 
retirements and movements (khilwat and jilwai ). The 
teacher has his own special exercises. These are personal, 
for himself and others, and for devotion to the activity. He 
has to practice detachment from people as such. 

He also engages in special acts of devotion and benevo¬ 
lence, in various forms, including religious ones. 

Clarke now places the section dealing with the duties of 
the disciple or learner (the Directed One) after the func¬ 
tions of the Sheikh, in variation from the original version. 
The first important point stressed is the necessity of the 
teacher to the disciple. The teacher's acceptance is the near¬ 
est thing to divine acceptance, and represents it as far as 
it can. The disciple's right to Sheikhly guidance is in part 
gained by a correct attitude toward his teacher. The Sheikh 
has this right of being honored. The disciple observes fifteen 
Rules of Conduct: 

He must repose complete faith in his Guide in instruct¬ 
ing, directing and purifying disciples. 

He must attend the teacher carefully and closely. 

He is obedient to the Sheikh. 

He abandons opposition, outwardly and inwardly. 

He accords his will with the will of the Director. 

He observes the thoughts of the Sheikh. 

He refers his dreams to the Sheikh for diagnosis of his 
thoughts. 

He is expectant of the words of the teacher. 

He lowers his voice before the Sheikh. 

He does not allow his selfishness to extend at large. He 
addresses his teacher as O Sayed (prince) or O Mmla 
(master). 



THE BOOK OE THE DERVISHES 30I 

He addresses his teacher with observance of the con¬ 
venience of the time. 

He must not speak of stages of mind and experience 
which are not his own; neither must he speak much to 
the teacher of his own stage. 

He must conceal the miracles of the teacher of which 
he may learn. 

He must reveal to the Sheikh his own experiences. 

He speaks to the Sheikh in a manner which the Sheikh 
will understand. 

Having arrived at the stage when the conventions of a 
dervish community may be studied, Colonel Clarke now 
summarizes Suhrawardi's fifth item in his own third section. 

When the dervish arrives at the convent, he tries to make 
it before the afternoon. He salutes the spot in prayer, and 
then shakes hands with those present. An offering, probably 
of food, is made to the dwellers. Dervishes are divided into 
two sections—dwellers and travelers. Dervishhood itself is 
often considered to be a certain condition or phase of 
being a Sufi, not invariably a vocation or permanent state. 
In this sense it cannot be compared with the monastic organ¬ 
ization of, say, Christianity or Buddhism. 

The dervish may stay three days at a convent as a guest. 
After this, he can stay if he can find some employment 
within the precincts which will occupy him correctly. 
Those who are engaged in a phase of continuous devotion 
do not perform physical service about the convent. 

There are three stages or conditions of dervishes to be 
found in the community considered dwellers. The first 
group, at the earliest stage, are the People of Service QAhl-i- 
Khidmat ). They serve the regular dwellers, and are at the 
earliest stage. They are at a stage before they can be given 
inner exercises, and can only carry out external ones, cou¬ 
pled with inner “intentions” which are not really develop¬ 
mental processes, though the servers may take them as such. 



THE SUFIS 


302 

Only by service do they become actually worthy of the de¬ 
gree of real service. 

The People of Society ( AhM-SiMat ) are often the 
younger ones, who spend time in sitting in house assemblies 
and carrying out mutual activities designed to provide the 
bond (knowledge) w h.ich reveals their reality and capabili¬ 
ties for the “work.” 

The People of Retirement QAhl-i-Khilwat) are generally 
the senior people, who spend much time in solitude, con¬ 
forming to die exercises which are proper to their stage. 

It is often the case that such an assembly of dervishes has 
no teacher among them. If this is the case, they are handi¬ 
capped. They are able only to prepare themselves for the 
association of a master. They cultivate trust and patience 
and contemplation. They must eat together, so that they be 
associated outwardly as well as inwardly. They have to strive 
at all times to be not only in agreement with each other, 
but also in a state of complete equality, one with the other. 
No hierarchical organization or leadership is possible to 
them. 

Travel, both physically and metaphorically, can be an im¬ 
portant part of dervish activity. The dervish travels in his 
own land (internally) and also through the countryside and 
from land to land (externally). Some Sheikhs spend no more 
than forty days in one place. “On dead skins, by tanning, 
the effects of purity, of softness, and of delicacy of texture 
appear; even so, by the tanning of travel, and by the depar¬ 
ture of natural corruption and innate roughness, appears the 
purifying softness of devotion and change from obstinacy to 
faith.” Yet dervishes may not travel at all. Those who have 
no teacher sometimes travel almost permanently. 

There are detailed programs for travel and the way in 
which its experience is utilized by the dervish. These are 
generally known as the Twelve Rules of Travel. 

The “dance” of the dervishes, the subject of so much 
misinterpretation, is divided into audition and movement. 
The real dervish is not a musician, in the sense that he does 



3°3 


THE BOOK OF THE DERVISHES 

not actually play instruments. Outside musicians or servers 
may do so. The Islamic authorities, “outward sages,” deny 
the permissibility of these activities, but they are permitted 
and encouraged in special circumstances and in accordance 
with needs by dervish saints and spiritual directors. There 
are grave disadvantages, amounting to complete negation of 
the “work,” inherent in the use of music and movement 
without an inner perception of what these are. Especially 
deleterious is any movement made during the audition of 
music, contrary to the custom when hearing music in a more 
lay situation, when movement is expected. 

The mantle (khirqa) has a great deal of symbolical im¬ 
portance to the dervish. He sews his own cloak, generally 
made up of patchwork pieces. The bestowing of the mantle 
is a mark of passing impalpable blessing or power ( baraka ) 
from one person to another. The succession of teacherhood 
is referred to as the inheritance of the mantle. The dervishes, 
in addition to much other lore, refer to the investiture by 
Mohammed of the Mother of Khalid with a mantle that 
nobody else wanted. It was a small black cloak, with yellow 
and red stripes, of the Bedouin sort. The Sufi mantle is 
dark blue or white. 

The selection of a deputy is marked thus: 

“When the Sheikh seeth in the disciple the effects of 
holiness and the marks of acquisition to the degree of ex¬ 
cellence and instruction; and wisheth to appoint hi rn his 
own successor—he clotheth him with the Robe of Holiness, 
and with the honor of his own favor, whereby may be ef¬ 
fected the perpetuating of his Order and the obeying of the 
people.” 

Amid much else, the tradition about robes divides der¬ 
vishes into three classes. The first take the mantle which 
the Sheikh allots for their use; the second have no special 
garb because they are in a “working” condition; the last 
choose their own garb because their choice has become an 
absolute, necessary, complete (objective) choice. 

The remainder of the material presented by Clarke is 



TUB SUFIS 


3°4 

best considered theoretical mixed with initiatory doctrine. 
The complexity is increased by the fact that many of the 
stages and experiences are conditional upon several factors. 
Sufism not being a static or simple proceeding, trying to 
heez e any stage can cause serious generalization and con¬ 
sequent distortion. For this reason the material is to be seen 
as primaril y illustrative, yet not without internal motion. 

Knowledge is represented in the dervish codex, as in 
mrrpnt and ancient usage, as knowledge in general. The 
divisions of knowledge, and its gradation, are the subject 
of important Sufi “work,” because each stage in the journey 
is characterize d by its appropriate knowledge. The general 
assumption that knowledge can be divided into two sorts— 
information and experience—is not accepted by Sufis. 

There are two forms, for instance, of aql, intelligence— 
the intelligenc e of the ordinary man, and that of the reli¬ 
gious one. The first is fit for this world and its affairs, the 
latter for the next world. This is characterized by guidance, 
sometimes referred to as illumination. 

Then there is ordinary knowledge, contrasted with inner, 
or deep knowledge. The first may be characterized by piety, 
the latter by perception of the workings of a divine activity. 
There is another form of knowledge, that of the theologist, 
which deals in such things as commands and prohibitions. 

These knowledges are pursued by three kinds of sages. 
The first is the sage of God, who has the three knowledges. 
The second kind of sage is he who contains the wisdom of 
the next world. The third path is that of the sage of this 
world. He knows only the outward forms of devotion. 

The real knowledge is a kind of nutrition, like food. 

Deep knowledge Qmaarifcct) is characterized by three sub¬ 
ordinate forms of knowledge. The first is the wisdom of how 
each word or agent acts. The second is the recognition of 
each agent in the "work.” The third is the recognition of 
the agent through thought. The man who recognizes in¬ 
stantaneously the meanings of happenings and actions, with- 



THE BOOK OE THE DERVISHES 305 

out ordinary reflection, is the arif, the Wise, the “arrived” 
Sufi, or the Mature One. 

There are forms of understanding and reunderstanding 
knowledge. These are described as: 

The Science of Inner Wisdom; 

The Wisdom of Science; 

The Science of the Wisdom of Wisdom. 

These are the simplest terms in which the succession of 
refinements of knowledge and wisdom can be rendered. 

The so-called mystical state ( hal ), and its relationship 
with the stage of the traveler, is the subject of the next sec¬ 
tion dealt with by Clarke. 

The mystical experience, which in other systems is con¬ 
sidered to be the be-all and end-all of the quest, is for the 
dervish nothing more than a prelude to the attainment of 
true association with objective reality. The way in which it 
is received and in which an interaction between it and the 
receptor takes place will determine whether it is producing 
a valid progress. 

This is a most important consideration, because it sharply 
divides Sufism from all other so-called mysticisms, whether 
induced by drugs, or any other ecstatogenic cause. 

“Stage” (makam) is the degree of permanent knowledge 
of truth (objectivity) which has been attained. Ecstasy, 
therefore, is or can be the instrument for the establishment 
of makam . 

“The hal is a gift; the makam is an acquisition.” 

And the mystical state, according to the Sheikhs of Khora- 
san, “is the heritage of deeds. Like lightning it appeareth, 
and effaced becometh.” Its manifestation is followed by 
concealment. It is transmuted, or transmutes the conscious¬ 
ness, providing contentment ( riza ). It is necessary to be¬ 
ware of the idea of progression or chronological development 
in these states, and Junaid has warned against this. He 
says: “From one hal one may advance to a higher one. From 
there he gains information wherewith he can amend his 
first state.” 



THE SUFIS 


306 

There is a ratification of each state, which makes possible 
advance to another, and also makes possible the perma¬ 
nency of progress, of stage. Without a certain methodology, 
state Old) is sporadic and repetitious, useless. 

The dervish conception of the nature of God is now 
given, although it appears in the original almost at the be¬ 
ginning of the textbook. 

The Sufi does not worship anything but God, the Unique, 
One. 

At the same time, the nature of God as understood by the 
Sufi is not susceptible to enunciation in the crude words 
which serve for other purposes. God's abode, for instance, is 
not where God is. The answer to the question is “He.” He 
is in the time of “He.” He made things resemble and suf¬ 
fice by means of “He.” 

There is no possibility of arguing the existence or place 
of God, because God is not susceptible to the criteria which 
are available. 

This knowledge is the product of what is called certitude 
( yakina), which has a modus operandi of its own, not an 
intellectual one. Therefore Sufism has its own science 
whereby it approaches the question. This science relies upon 
practice, not speculation. 

Dealing with matters which are generally termed “of the 
next world,” the book stresses the dangers of assumption that 
this form of being will be something which we can con¬ 
ceive within the coarse perceptions which we habitually 
employ for crude measurement. 

Attempts to reason out the relationship between the 
familiar and the concept of the next world will end in loss. 
When reason passes beyond its own limits, error results. 

Similarly, there is a limit to the efficient working of 
imagination and fancy. The imaginary picture evoked by 
the name of a person not so far seen may or may not ap¬ 
proximate to the reality. 

Two main forces are used by those who have no insight, 
to combat those who have. The first force is that of the Men 



THE BOOK OF THE DERVISHES 307 

of Power, who kill, punish and harm. The second is that of 
the People of Learning, who use deceit, hypocrisy and 
heresy. 

“Steadiness” is a technical term which is associated with 
remaining steadfast, conscious of the presence of God, con¬ 
sidering that God is watching. This causes awareness of 
oneself and what one is and what doing. 

In this condition the worshiper maintains an outward 
and inward adornment of rules. The inward knowledge on 
the basis of which this is done is called contemplation, 
watching ( muraqibd ). 

Those who are in this stage say, “Yesterday is dead; 
tomorrow is not bom; today is in the agonies of death.” 

Those concentrating upon exercises connected with the 
past or the future are in a state of destruction. “The safety 
and the salvation of the people is in their being engaged in 
the ordinance of the time.” 

One of the specialist Sufic sciences is called the Science 
of State Qlm-i-haV), The usage of this science varies in ac¬ 
cordance with the capacities of the practitioners. There is 
no Sufi science greater than this, because it is the methodol¬ 
ogy whereby the gradations of hal are observed and applied. 

The science involves the interaction of states of mind 
and their relation to the physical happenings in the sur¬ 
roundings. 

The Science of Certainty is the revelation of truth (ob¬ 
jective reality) through special states by experience, not 
by cerebration as we understand it in the conventional 
world. 

There are three phases of the Science (practice and per¬ 
ception) of Certainty, allegorized by calling the Sun ob¬ 
jectivity: The first, seeking guidance from the splendor and 
understanding of the heat of the Sun. The second, by 
actually seeing the body of the Sun. The third, the dispers¬ 
ing of die eyes* light in the light of the Sun itself. 

There are three stages of “certainty,” then, which Suhra- 
wardi summarizes as: 



THE SUFIS 


308 

The Knowledge of Certitude, in which it is known, veri¬ 
fied and evident; 

The Essence of Certainty, manifest and witnessed; 

The Truth (Reality) of Certainty, a double way in which 
there is a conjoining of the witnesser and witnessed. 

Beyond this point words do not suffice, and the dervish is 
accused of pantheism and more. An attempt at explaining 
produces the word sequence, “The seer becometh the eye, 
the eye, the seer.” A distortion of meaning, originating from 
the attempt to enunciate the process in formal terms, is 
perpetuated by the reader, who cannot penetrate by the un¬ 
aided intellect the real significance of the phrase. 

The doctrine of essence, and its connection with the per¬ 
sonality and the self, is a most important part of dervish 
study. There are, for illustrative purposes, two kinds of es¬ 
sence: 

The first is the essence of a thing, which is the inner es¬ 
sence Qdhat) and the truth ( hakikat ) of that thing. Truth 
here means objective reality, the inner meaning. People nor¬ 
mally see or perceive only the outward use of a thing, are 
ignorant of any ultimate function of that thing. A lamp, 
for example, gives light It may be used for heating, or for 
decoration. But other functions of its true reality are imper¬ 
ceptible to the ordinary man. If, by a stretch of imagination, 
it were found through delicate scientific measurement that 
the lamp was giving off certain communication rays, this 
activity might be the expression of the true reality or essence 
of that lamp. 

Then there is the human essence, called the rational es¬ 
sence (the human spirit) which is known as the ‘luminos¬ 
ity.” This is the sum total of the grace ( baraka, impalpable 
qualities) of the individual. 

The perceiving of the operation and being of these ele¬ 
ments is an extremely sensitive one. True, inner knowledge 
of the essence is hinted at in the religious life. Hence: “Hints 
as to the knowledge of essence are found in the links and 
conditions of the knowledge of God.” 



THE BOOK OE THE DERVISHES 309 

This assertion shows how all dervish teaching is based not 
on the concept of God, but on the concept of essence. There 
is a slogan which summarizes this, and which clearly estab¬ 
lishes that the religious context of dervish thinking is merely 
the vehicle for the self-realization which is aimed at: “He 
who knows his essential self, knows his God.” Knowledge of 
the essential self is the first step, before which there is no 
real knowledge of religion. Sufis are accused of paganism 
because they first apply themselves to this problem, retain¬ 
ing the religious context as a practical working shape, rather 
than as any indication of final and objective truth. 

The means of appreciating the various stages and condi¬ 
tions of the essence and its progressive refinement are them¬ 
selves an essential part of dervish activity. It is here that the 
dervish parts company with the mere theoretician. The latter 
says: “I will think this out;” the dervish: “I will prepare 
myself to perceive this, without using limited, obstructive 
thought, a childish process.” 

The “veiling” or interruption of the correct use of the 
human spirit (essence) is caused by an unbalanced indul¬ 
gence in certain coarse sentiments which together consti¬ 
tute a pattern of imprisonment (conditioning) characteristic 
of most people. These “veils” or “blameable qualities” are 
listed as ten: 

1. Desire. Desires based on ignorance of what should be, 
and on assumptions as to what is good for the individual. 
Austerity, correctly used, is the antidote to irrational desire. 
This is the stage of “I want a lollipop.” 

2. Separation* This is a type of hypocrisy, when the per¬ 
son uses rationalization to justify thoughts and actions 
which are centered upon himself, not upon an ul timat e 
reality. The antidote is the practice of sincerity. 

3. Hypocrisy . Characterized by self-pride, glorying in pos¬ 
sessions, pseudoindependence, violence. This is overcome 
only by the practice of qualities which are reprehensible in 
the eyes of the people, but laudable in God's sight. They 
include submission of the right kind, humility and the 



THE SUFIS 


310 

poverty of the Fakir. These qualities are recognized only 
by correct assessment of the true worth of their opposites. 

4. Desire for Praise and Love . Narcissism, which pre¬ 
cludes objective assessment of oneself; lack of a balancing 
factor which amounts almost to self-contempt. 

5. Illusions of almost divine importance. Countered only 
by the glory of the qualities of God. 

6. Avarice and Parsimony . Give rise to envy, the worst of 
all characteristics. This can be dissolved only when the 
power of certainty ( yakina ) comes. 

7. Greed and the desire for more. This is dangerous 
because it causes the person to be like the moth, insensately 
dashing itself against the candle flame. It is countered only 
by austerity and piety. 

8. Irresponsibility . This is manifested by the desire to 
attain something which has been conceived in the mind. 
It is always in motion, like a globe continually turning. It 
can be made to depart only by patience. 

9. Haste to Fatigue . This is lack of constancy of purpose, 
in its usual manifestation. This is what prevents people 
from realizing that there is a succession of objectives which 
will replace present, crude ones. “From this calamity it is 
impossible to escape save by the establishing of the ordered 
thanks.” Exercises are employed to overcome this tendency. 

10. Negligence . Slothfulness of a deep kind is shown 
by lack of awareness of the needs of a situation or an in¬ 
dividual, Alertness is cultivated through remedies applied 
by the “Physicians of the Essence”—the dervishes. 

It will be noted that ordinary, contemporary psychother¬ 
apy attempts the treatment of some of these conditions, but 
only in order to guide the mind into a pattern which the 
psychological doctrine assumes is normal. According to the 
dervish, the conditions which have to be treated are due to 
an unharmonious state of the mind, groping for balance 
and evolution. It is impossible, from this point of view, to 
attempt to restore a mere equilibrium without a dynamic 
forward movement. The psychologist tries to make a warped 



THE BOOK OF THE DERVISHES 311 

wheel turn smoothly. The dervish is trying to make the 
wheel turn in order that it may propel a carriage. 

'The Deep Knowledge of the Spirit"—Section HI of the 
dervish book and placed eleventh in Colonel Clarke’s ver¬ 
sion—involves a form of exposition where many theories 
meet. This chapter, when read in the light of Sufi technical 
terminology, shows how the progress of the human mind to 
realization accords with the symbols of religion. Words like 
"angels," "Adam and Eve," "grace," are here used in such a 
manner as to show how the Sufi thinkers interpreted the 
religious lore to give an insight in exactly what processes 
were symbolized by what have been widely accepted as 
historical or legendary tales, or supernatural phenomena. 

Whatever the literal truth of the making of Eve from 
Adam’s rib may be, the dervish Suhrawardi teaches the 
Sufi understanding of the event as a continuously repeated 
process of a mystical kind. 

"In every person of mankind, another exemplar becometh 
—by the union of spirit and essence (in part)—transcribed 
from the exemplar of Adam and Eve." What is called "heart" 
is the combination of Adam and Eve, the soul and the es¬ 
sence. The male element comes from the universal soul. The 
female element comes from the universal essence. It is this 
essence which man (Adam) contacts within himse lf and 
brings forth in the form of Eve. Eve being brought forth 
from Adam therefore represents the special, inner, cognition 
of the true (objective) essence, produced by mankind from 
its interior resources. 

For explanations of this psychological land, the result of 
actual experiences of a successive nature, the dervishes were 
considered by orthodox theologians to be apostates, discount¬ 
ing the literal interpretation of the Scriptures. But the his¬ 
torical reality or the folklore version of Scriptural stories are 
of no interest to the dervish. He has transcended the 
vehicle. "To Adam, all names became known." 

All created things are the outcome of an interchange be¬ 
tween the two principles which are called essence and soul: 



THE SUFIS 


312 

“By reason of active deed, of passive deed and power, of 
weakness, the attribute of male and female appeareth; in the 
soul of increase and universal essence, the custom of love- 
making became confirmed by the link of temperament; by 
means of marriage, the races of worlds became existing and 
by the hand of the midwife of Fate appeared in the appar¬ 
ent world.” 

There are successive rarefications of true reality, each 
one appearing as absolute in its own field of perceptivity. 
“Breath is the result of spirit, spirit of order.” 

The angels, as other dervish teachers have stressed, are 
the higher developments of the mind. Some are spoken of 
here as being of the nature of jamal (beauty), others of the 
nature of jalal (grandeur). 

The doctrine of “collection and dispersion” ([jami and 
tafrika ) as expounded in this section deals with the rela¬ 
tionship between life in the world and life in other dimen¬ 
sions. The Knower, the Complete Sufi, is in the world, yet 
not of it. He is in a state of correct harmony with the con¬ 
tinuum of which apparent existence is only a minor por¬ 
tion. He is aligned with the body and the non-body, as they 
must be represented in ordinary exposition. He understands 
the modalities which give rise to the belief in the existence 
of creation and the absolute which underlies it. 

“Shining and concealment” are the twin terms which deal 
with the manifestation and lack of perception of God in 
humanity. “Shining” means the breaking through of the 
sun of the reality of God from the clouds of humanity. The 
clouds are the aspect of hiddenness of this objectivity. 

The famous romance of Majnun (“the madman ) and 
Layla is used to allegorize the power of the “shining” and 
the inability of the traveler (madman) to sustain the bril¬ 
liance of that shining without having passed through a 
necessary preparation. 

The tribe of the madman interceded with some of the 
people of Layla, asking that Majnun be allowed to be il¬ 
luminated with the “sight of Layla s beauty. 



the book of the dervishes 313 

Layla’s tribe replied that there was no harm in this: “But 
Majnun hath not the power of beholding Layla’s beauty.” 

They brought the madman, and for him lifted a comer 
of Layla’s tent, immediately his glance fell on the fold of 
Layla’s skirt-senseless he fell.” 

Illumination cannot be sustained by someone who is not 
ready for it. At the best it will throw him into an ecstatic 
state in which he is paralyzed, as it were, and unable to 
consummate the contact. This is why, although dervish poets 
speak of being “mad for love,” they emphasize that this mad¬ 
ness is the result of preview, not of genuine experience. It 
is recognized that genuine experience must take an active, 
mutual, meaningful form, not a form of useless intoxication. 

Inebriation mystics are those who stop short at this stage, 
and try to reproduce the experience repetitiously, or ap¬ 
proximate them on paper or in emotional art. This is the 
stage at which much experimentation in mysticism be¬ 
comes bogged down. 

“Rapture” ( wajd) and “existence” (wujud) refer to two 
states of which the first is the prelude to the second 
Outlaid). In rapture, the individual is immersed in a sen¬ 
sation which is opposite to the one which he formerly felt. 
He also becomes attuned to a form of cognition other than 
that to which he is accustomed. A person experiences this 
state when he is still at the stage when he is primitively 
linked with sensual qualities and has little understanding 
of any deeper perspective to them. 

Existence is the name given to the state of “acquisition,” 
when real existence, as opposed to simple physical existence, 
is perceived by the devotee. 

“Period” and “moment” are two concepts which are as¬ 
sociated with a moment of perception on contact, a momen¬ 
tary cognition, the instrument of fashioning further states 
of being. Several other concepts and exercises are associated 
with these two. One such is the exercise of the freezing of 
movement, temporarily stopping ordinary associative proc¬ 
esses. Another is the use of the Pause of Time, and the 


THE SUFIS 


314 

Pause of Space, which enable the operation of constructive 
“time” to take place, 

A Complete Sufi may be called a Master of Time, mean¬ 
ing master of starting and stopping, of modifying cognition. 
The individual who can operate in this sphere is called (by 
the sage Shibli) one who has escaped from being under the 
sway of hal, the mystical state of rapturous but generalized 
joy. 

Moment is the term given also to “breath.” It stands for 
the physical exercises connected with breathing, and also 
for the illustration of the fact that Sufi development is a 
succession, like the pulsation of breath, not a static condi¬ 
tion or irregular motion. 

Thus: “Moment is a state in a place of ‘stopping/ Breath 
is a state free from ‘stopping/ Time' is for the beginner. 
Breath is for the finisher, completer.” 

“Presence” and “absence” (shuhud and ghaybat) are 
terms which connote states of Sufihood which may be quite 
imperceptible to the ordinary man or woman. The dervish 
may be present as far as the invisible world is concerned, 
yet absent as far as the familiar one is concerned. 

Sir Sayed Ahmad Khan defines absence of this kind as 
whatever is outside our sight, like the force of gravitation. 

Shibli went to visit another great sage, Junaid. The wife 
of the latter was about to conceal herself modestly behind 
a screen. Junaid said, “Stay where you are—Shibli is absent.” 
At that moment, Shibli began to weep. Junaid said, “You 
must now be absent, for Shibli has returned.” Being absent 
or hidden means that the dervish is working in another 
dimension, and appears to be absent. 

This is not the same as absentmindedness, which is not 
itself a constructive or positive state. Junaid’s wife could not 
see Shibli's absentness; Junaid had to perceive it. Similarly, 
the ordinary man denies even the possibility of such a state, 
because he cannot perceive it. For him, it is not only ab¬ 
sent, but hidden, concealed, like the concealment of Shibli. 

Presence, of course, is another variety of absence, depend- 



THE BOOK OP THE DERVISHES 315 

ing upon the point of view: “Present with God is absent to 
men.” Some dervishes alternate between this polarity, per¬ 
haps slowly, perhaps instantaneously. When the complete 
alchemicalization has taken place, there is no duality. They 
are constantly in the state of presence, and they are not hid¬ 
den from either world. 

The methodology of the dervishes includes the use of 
exercises designed to produce tajrid (outward detachment) 
and tajrid (interior solitude). The correct balance of inte¬ 
gration of the special faculties can be attained by “outwardly 
abandoning the desires of this world, and inwardly rejecting 
the compensation of the next world and of this world.” This 
is tajrid. 

Tafrid is not essential to tajrid. But it is associated with it, 
or may be so. It involves the “rejecting of the increase of 
deeds of himself, and the concealing of their appearance by 
regarding on himself God's favor and bounty.” 

This method illuminates the developmental shortcomings 
in ordinary religion, which focuses the attention upon the 
next world. This, for the dervish, is a primary stage, which 
has to be shed when the time of actual amal (labor) starts. 

The obliteration and confirming of the slave's existence is 
the interpretation of the twin words mahw (obliteration) 
and isbat (confirmation). This schematic representation of 
an aspect of dervish being is widely misunderstood by lay¬ 
men. Every obliteration is a confirmation—obliteration of 
undesirable or negative qualities produces the activation of 
equal and opposite positive qualities. Superficial conjecture 
has labeled this theory and its processes as a negation of 
the intellect or mind of the dervish. By default, because 
dervishes are working and not theorizing or concerned with 
exegesis, this label has adhered to the words. 

“Change” Qtdwin ) and “rest” ( tamkin ) refer to attitudes 
of mind and body, as well as inner conditions. Rest is the 
term used for the permanency of manifestation of Truth. 
In this condition the dervish experiences a permanent tran- 



316 THE SUFIS 

guillity of heart which enables him to perceive true reality, 
or objective fact, generally called Truth. 

Change is the exercise and also the condition of tranquil¬ 
lity of the heart, by the pursuance of exercises of presence 
and absence, as already noted, and other procedures. 

The prayer exercises, in which the special interpretations 
and uses of the formulas of Islam are concentrated upon, 
form a great part of the rest of Colonel Clarke’s version of 
the Gifts . Then come the allegorical meanings of austerity, 
of poverty and humility, of celibacy and marriage, trustful¬ 
ness, contentment and love. 

Love is the great theme which runs through the ocean of 
Sufi poetry and the personal teachings of the masters alike. 
Love is essentially the creator of states of experience, which 
are themselves referred to as “gifts.” There are two general 
forms of love—Ordinary Love and Special Love. Those who 
have not followed the developments possible in this field of 
the Sufis constantly confuse the one with the other, in a 
blurring alternation which deceives their perception. Such 
people make, for instance, serious errors in assessment of 
individuals, groups and situations. Aware of this, they gener¬ 
ally are at pains to try to retrieve their mistakes subsequently 
(rationalization), and in consequence may appear absurd 
to those who observe them, whether initiates or otherwise. 
Self-deception is a symptom of this form of love, whose sin¬ 
cerity is not questioned. Its quality is, however, subject 
to fluctuations imperceptible to the individual. 

The comparisons between Ordinary and Special Love 
are listed. A perception of bar aka (impalpable beauty, grace) 
in the form or apparent being of a thing is a quality of 
Ordinary Love. When this becomes profound (Special) love, 
it is transmuted into the selFs inclination to viewing the 
beauty of the essence Qdhat )—not the form. The effect of 
love is shown by contrasting love which beautifies existence 
(Ordinary Love) with love which refines existence (Special 
Love). 

Real love, of the essential type, is not general but specific. 



THE BOOK OB THE DERVISHES 317 

It may observe beauty in all forms, but its attention is 
actually directed upon the essence which is the only love 
in a final sense. A person does not love in this sense if his 
love is capable of distraction. This is illustrated by a tale: 

A man once met a beautiful woman. He revealed his 
love to her. She said, “Beside me is one who is more beautiful 
than I, and more perfect in beauty. She is my sister.” He 
looked to see this woman. Then the first one said: “Boaster! 
When I saw you from afar, I thought that you were a wise 
man. When you came near, I thought that you were a lover. 
Now I know that you are neither.” 

The wisdom of the dervishes portrays a characteristic of 
love which is so rare as to be almost unconceived by the rest 
of humanity. The lover thinks greatly of even slight regard 
from his beloved. But of his own regard for her, he thinks 
little. Seen in this light, the feelings of Ordinary Love re¬ 
flect egocentricity. 

Clarke retains in his version a number of definitions of 
Sufi individuals and states which are not susceptible to sim¬ 
ple exposition. In the seventy-odd years since his book ap¬ 
peared, it must be admitted that the Sufi sense of varying 
definition in accordance with many factors has not been 
established in, say, English. But this is probably inevitable 
while dictionaries retain the assumption that brevity is pos¬ 
sible in all definitions. 

A Fakir, for instance, is one who is poor. He is not neces¬ 
sarily a zahid , which is an austere man who may or may 
not be poor. But a Fakir may be a person who is at one time 
austere and at another time not. Similarly an austere per¬ 
son may not be a Fakir in the sense of deliberate intellectual 
poverty or humility. The Fakir has abandoned belief in the 
exaggerated significance of familiar chattels. To this extent 
e is good, or suitable for the Path. He may even abandon 
all idea of stages of development, of states or even deeds. But 
he can do this only when he has arrived at the condition 
when this is possible to him; when this becomes his function, 
not his choice. The Sufi is superior to the Fakir, because the 


3X8 THE SUFIS 

Fakir initially desires Fakirhood, and the Sufi desires 
nothing. So a Fakir may become a Sufi, in which case his 
Fakirhood is negated, nullified. 

No stabilizati on of Sufic terms is ultimately possible, 
though looking at the whole of the Sufi lore and some uses 
of the given to Sufis can give an impression as to how 
the system works. 

What is a dervish? 

The Rev. Joseph Wolff made a perilous journey through 
Asia in the nineteenth century, seeking Stoddard and 
Conolly, two British officers held by the Emir of Bokhara. 
A former Jew and priest of the Church of England, he had 
the blessing of influential people in Britain. He was able 
to travel freely in Central Asia only because he called him¬ 
self “the Christian Dervish,” capitalizing on the prestige of 
the noun. 

A dervish is a Sufi. In North Africa, “dervish” is a term 
of respect, denoting something less than an arif CKnower, 
Wise One), while a Sufi is looked at askance as someone 
engaged in mysterious processes. In England, a Sufi is 
thought to be “a Mohammedan mystic of the pantheistic 
type,” while a dervish is something weird—what a Nortt 
African might call a “Sufi.” 

Although even kings may sign themselves “Fakir,” th&lt; 
label can be embarrassing in some places. A distinguishec 
Indian academi cia n said: " ‘Fakir’ is confused with Hindi 
jugglers—and worse. I regard you not as a Fakir, but as i 
Man of the Path.” 

Putting the word into a phrase helps to establish tb 
usage. “He is a dervish,” means, “a good, simple person 
devoted to truth.” “He is a Fakir,” means, “one who struggle 
to improve himself, with humility.” “He is a Sufi, mean: 
“one who follows the Sufi Way,” also, “one who has attain© 
progress in the Way.” 

The confusion arises because of several factors. Not lea: 
of these is the fact that the Sufis themselves do not us 
labels to denote fixed states or stages, since there is no sue 


THE BOOK OB THE DERVISHES 319 

thing in Sufism. You can label a pound of butter “butter,” 
but a Sufi is never entirely a dervish or a Knower. His status 
changes in relation to the infinite gradations of truth and 
objectivity. 

In Sufi literature, the words “Sufi,” “dervish” and “Fa kir ” 
are used more rarely than “Knower,” “lover,” “follower,” 
“traveler.” The other words tend to be externalist labels. 

In Sufism, the shortcomings of dictionary definitions are 
exposed perhaps more strikingly than in other fields. Thus 
Chambers ' Dictionary (1955 edition): 

DERVISH: “A member of one of numerous Mohammedan 
fraternities. . . .” 

SUFI: "A pantheistic Mohammedan mystic. . . .” 

FAKIR: “A religious (esp. Mohammedan) mendicant, 

ascetic. . . .” 

The meanings of the word “Mohammed”—or even “Mo¬ 
hammedan”—“fraternity,” “pantheism,” “mystic,” “religion,” 

* mendicant” and “ascetic” are different in Eastern usage, 
and especially in Sufi application, than in English. 

A Persian dictionary, perhaps more poetically, if with less 
seeming precision, says: “What is a Sufi? A Sufi is a Sufi” 
—and succeeds in rhyming the entry: Sufi chist?—Sufi 
Sufi st. This is actually a Sufi quotation. The compiler does 
not believe in trying to define the indefinable. An Urdu one 
says: Sufi refers to any one of numerous special, but suc¬ 
cessively necessary, stages of being, open to humanity under 
certain circumstances, understood correctly only by those 
who are in this state of ‘work* (jamaT)\ considered myste¬ 
rious, inaccessible or invisible to those who have not the 
means of perceiving it.” 

Clarke quotes Sufi literature of most of the classical 
authors over a period of seven hundred years (from 911 to 
1 670)—Persians, Afghans, Turkestanis, Arabs, Indians. His 
Western sources range from 1787 to 1881, nearly a hundred 
years. His translation of the Gifts was published by the 
Government of India's press at Calcutta.

This particular work is suited to exposition outside its 
nominal cultural pattern partly because it is itself the prod¬ 
uct of a school which interlaces, crossing and recrossing 
the traditional Sufic stream over the centuries during which 
the dervish format has been familiarly overt. 

This interplay is important, because it shows how the 
Sufic stream meets, blends and recombines in a manner 
which superficial observation of the dervish orders would 
not expect. 

The author of this book was Sheikh Shahabudin Mo¬ 
hammed the Suhrawardi, a disciple of the founder of the 
Suhrawardi Order of dervishes. The Order was founded on 
the teaching school by Ziyauddin Najib Suhrawardi, who 
died in 1167. He wrote the Observances of the Disciples . 
His life, like that of many initiating teachers, is not well 
documented. This is a part of deliberate policy, when the 
founder of a school intends to focus attention upon the 
school and not upon personalities. 

Our author, his disciple, was the chief Sufi teacher of 
Baghdad, a source of the concentration and transmission 
of the Sufic lore for his time. 

His disciples traveled far and wide, carrying the meth¬ 
odology of the Order. Sayed Nurudin of Afghanistan 
(Ghazna) brought the system to India, where King Alta- 
iriflsh made him the highest ecclesiastical dignitary of the | 
State. Another disciple was Najmuddin Kubra, who 
founded his own Order—the Kubravi—and who was master 
of all manner of miracles. He exercised, for instance, an, 
uncanny influence even on animals, merely by means of 
thought projection. So many of his disciples became masters 
through his baraka that his title is “Fashioner of Saints": 
Few Sufis have excelled these in their power or popularity.; 
The Suhrawardi Order is found throughout the Moslem; 
world, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. 

In one place, a Bokhara Suhrawardi dervish master 
(Shamsuddin Hussein) made four hundred thousand dis¬ 
ciples. He married the daughter of the Turkish Sultan 
Bayazid I, Nilufer Khanum. j 


THE BOOK OF THE DERVISHES 321 

The great poet Saadi of Shiraz was a disciple of our 
author, who was himself the nephew and successor to the 
founder of the Order. 

The baraka of the Order is traced to the same classical 
Sufi masters who provided the inspiration for the other 
Orders and schools. Therefore the essential character of the 
teaching is to be seen as colored only slightly by its repre¬ 
sentation in the organization known as the Suhrawardi 
Way, the last word normally translated by Westerners as 
“Order.” 

Stemming from the same origins were the Sufi masters 
who considered that the Suhrawardiyya, as it is called in 
Arabic, represented the correct alignment of Sufi teaching 
of the time. Hence there is a sort of interchangeability in 
membership of Orders which can appear confusing. Some 
of the famous masters were Sayeds, descendants of Moham¬ 
med; others were direct descendants of other Orders, like 
Bahauddin Zakaria, grandson of the founder of the Qadiri 
Order. The Grand Sheikh Jalaluddin of Tabriz was nur¬ 
tured by the Suhrawardiyya, then joined the Chishti Order 
after seven years with Shahabudin at Baghdad. Sufism here 
is to be seen as a means of concentrating a certain teaching 
and passing it on, through a human vehicle, through cli¬ 
mates prepared for its reception. Before and after Clarke, 
this has been attempted in Europe, with varying success. 
In most cases the effect has been to draw the individual 
back to the roots of the teaching in the East, where it is 
still concentrated. There have been many Sufis living and 
working in the West, but it is only recently that the correct 
conditions have existed for the naturalization or reintroduc¬ 
tion of a genuine transmission school in the ^Western world. 
The impatience of many would-be students is only faintly 
useful in the evolution of such a work. 

Among the cornerstones for this kind of development, 
Colonel Clarke’s version of the Gifts is undoubtedly to be 
mentioned. 



The Dervish Orders 


Because of superficial thought 
What appears to be hypocrisy in 
The enlightened ones 
Is in fact better than 

What is felt to be sincerity in the beginner. 

(Hadrat Bayazid el-Bistami) 


Almost all Sufis, at one time or another, are members of 
one of the Ways which are called by Western scholars 
"Orders," in allusion to their supposed similarity to the 
Christian religious orders of the middle ages. There are 
several very important differences between the two kinds 
of organizations. 

The Order, for the Sufi, is not a self-perpetuating entity 
with a fixed hierarchy and premises, forming a training 
system for the devotee. The nature of Sufism being evolu¬ 
tionary, it is by definition impossible for a Sufi body to take 
any permanent form as rigid as this. In certain places, and 
under individual masters, schools appear and carry out an 
activity designed to further the human need for completion 
of the individual. These schools (like that of Rumi and 
Data Ganj Bakhsh, for example) attract very large num¬ 
bers of people who are not Moslems, although Sufi schools 
have always, since the rise of Islam, been presided over by 
people who originate in the Moslem tradition. 

Again, while Sufi Orders have specific rules and set forms 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 323 

of dress and ritual, these are not invariable, and the extent 
to which the Sufi adheres to these forms is determined by 
his need for them, as prescribed by his master. 

Some of the great Ways have detailed histories, but the 
tendency to divide into departments of specialization means 
that schools at times share each others’ nominal character¬ 
istics. This is because the Way is being developed by means 
of an inner necessity, not piloted by the externals of its 
apparent organizational framework. 

So secret are many of the schools that when one of the 
greatest of all Sufis, Hujwiri (died 1063) wrote a book 1 
dealing with Sufism and the Orders in the eleventh century, 
giving inside information about them, it was actually as¬ 
sumed by some that he had invented or concocted part of 
the material. 

Even this development itself, contrary to what people as¬ 
sumed, was a part of inevitable dervish policy. Data 
(“dervish” in Hindi) Ganj Bakhsh (Munificent One) is 
the name by which Ali el-Hujwiri is known in India. 

Bom in Ghazna (Afghanistan), he is referred to by the 
Sufis as “the Selected,” the man chosen to make known 
certain facts about Sufism and Sufi organization, for the 
purpose of its projection in the Indian field. Although by 
no means the first Sufi to settle in India (he is buried in 
Lahore, Pakistan, and his beautiful tomb is venerated by 
people of all creeds), his task was to establish there by his 
life and works a claim that Sufism was thoroughly con¬ 
sistent with the principles of Islam. His importance can 
hardly be overemphasized. As the Christian writer John 
Subhan says: 

Ali el-Hujwiri’s tomb may still be seen in Lahore near 
the Bhati gate. It has been an object of veneration and 
a place of pilgrimage for the best part of nine hundred 
years. All sorts and conditions of men, kings and beg¬ 
gars, have resorted to it through the centuries, seeking 

1 Kashf el-Mahjub (The Revelation of the Veiled). 



324 THE SUFIS 

spiritual and temporal blessings. Most of the Moslem 
invaders and wandering dervishes, on entering the 
land, made a point of paying their homage at his 
shrine. 2 

Hujwiri’s place among Sufis is next only to his impor¬ 
tance as an interpreter of Sufism to the Moslems themselves. 
For the Sufi, The Revelation of the Veiled contains ma¬ 
terial which only he can understand, concealed within the 
form of a book designed to be read by pious Moslems to 
introduce them to the Sufi way of thought through the 
familiar terminology of their formal tradition. 

The book is carefully studied by members of most of the 
Orders. Hujwiri himself studied under Abu el-Qasim 
Gurgani, a great teacher of the Naqshbandi Order, and 
his main work is the Revelation , which is the first book in 
Persian on Sufism and the Orders. 

The book contains lives of notable Sufis, of ancient and 
contemporary times, references to doctrines, alms, prayer, 
faith and mysticism. It is addressed to those who wish to 
approach Sufism through the prevailing context of Islam. 
Beyond this obvious presentation, the Revelation conceals, 
in a manner discernible only to Sufis, information about 
the use and meaning of the secret language which the Sufis 
use in order to communicate and carry on their special 
training. 

All that can be revealed about this for the moment is 
contained in the chapter on the patched robe. The wearing 
of patched cloaks is a Sufi custom, the mark of the 
practicing Sufi on the Path. It might be called the uniform 
of the wandering dervish, and it has been seen in almost 
every part of Asia and Europe for nearly fourteen hundred 
years. The Prophet Mohammed and some of his companions 
showed their adherence to the Sufi Way by their adoption 
of this garb. Many Sufi teachers are on record about the 
2 John A. Subhan, Sufism, Its Saints and Shrines, Lucknow, 1938, 
p. 130. 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 


325 

method of sewing on the patches, whether they should be 
large or small, who should wear the robe, who can confer 
it, and so on. The whole phenomenon is a part of the 
mystery of the Sufis. 

Hujwiri’s chapter on patched robes, read for its super¬ 
ficial value, might satisfy a devout theologian. Dwelling 
upon the connection between patches and poverty, upon 
the industry needed to sew a patch correctly, upon the out¬ 
ward affirmation of asceticism which the patches conveyed, 
the chapter could read as a rather pious, very unsatisfactory 
collection of ideas and facts, assembled for sentimental pur¬ 
poses. The fact is very different. 

When reading the text, the student has to know, first of 
all, that he cannot translate the word as “patch” and leave 
it at that. He must look for the concepts which are con¬ 
tained in the Arabic word, and keep them all in mind, 
a PP¥ng them to the text in a certain manner. Then he 
will see whether the writer means “patch,” or “walking,” or 
“divine fool,” and so on. 

The effect of the book upon the Sufi is now very different 
from the rendering which he would get from a superficial 
reading. Here is an example of semiliteral translation, taken 
from Professor Nicholson’s translation of the chapter: 

“To take pains in sewing patched robes is considered 
allowable by the Sufis because they have gained a high rep¬ 
utation among the people; and since many imitate them 
and wear patched robes, and are guilty of improper acts, 
and since the Sufis dislike the society of others than them¬ 
selves—for these reasons they have invented a garb which 
none but themselves can sew, and have made it a mark of 
mutual acquaintance and a badge. So much so that when 
a certain dervish came to one of the Shaykhs wearing a 
garment on which the patch had been sewn with wide 
stitches, the Shaykh banished him from his presence.” 

The Arabic root from which the word “patch” is derived 
also embraces an important group of meanings. Among 
these we may note: 



THE SUFIS 


326 

1. Nonsensical Qraqua '). How the Sufi appears when 
he is talking or behaving in terms of an extra cognition, 
imperceptible to the ordinary man. The motley of the jester 
is a fair translation of this quality. "Fool,” in the Sufi sense, 
is also from the same root, spelled arqdcu 

2. To be addicted to wine (raqad'). Sufis use the anal¬ 
ogy of intoxication to refer to a certain mystical experience. 

3. Heedless ( artaqd'). The Sufi appears to be heedless 
of things which seem most important to the ordinary man, 
but which, objectively, may have another significance. 

4. Seventh Heaven ( raqd'). An allusion to the celestial 
or divine quality of Sufism. 

5. Chessboard Qruqdat ). The black and white alterna¬ 
tion of light and dark, part of the checker pattern of the 
floor of certain dervish meeting places. 

6. Patched garment Qmuraqqd'). The only word of this 
group other than the last one which can be used as a symbol 
or implement, an allegorical object summarizing the root 
as a whole and all its Sufi meanings. 

7. To patch a garment; to walk quickly; to epigram- 
matize; to hit a target with an arrow are all derivations of 
the same root through the word raqd a, 

8. To repair (a well). Symbolizing the rectification of 
the existing “well” of human knowledge in humanity by 
the Sufis shares the same root. 

One of Hujwiri’s tasks was to pass on in written form, 
concealed in Sufic cipher, essential elements which were to 
be used by dervish schools. 

Hujwiri’s coming to India was in accordance with the 
travel technique practiced widely in the Orders. He was 
told by his teacher to go and settle in Lahore. This was the 
last thing that he wanted to do, but since he was under the 
complete discipline existing between student and master, 
he set out for India. The moment he arrived at Lahore he 
saw that the body of Sheikh Hasan Zanjani was being 
taken to his grave. Hujwiri was his successor, and realized 
now that he had been sent for this reason. Such examples 



3^7 


THE DERVISH ORDERS 

of replacement of Sufi teachers who are about to die by one 
sent from a great distance are not rare in dervish annals. 

Hujwiri founded no Order, but remains a teacher shared 
in general. His name stands in the list of teachers whose 
baraka extends throughout the whole of the dervish com¬ 
munity, irrespective of the time in which he lived. After 
he died, it is believed, his authority continued on earth, be¬ 
cause his perfection had reached such a degree that ordi¬ 
nary death did not dissolve it 

Sufi Orders may be organized in a monastic form. On 
the other hand, the Sufi monastery or school may consist of 
a linking of people and activities spread over an immense 
area and invisible to the outsider. Hence there are Orders 
—and especially branches of Orders—with some members in 
India, others in Africa, some in Indonesia. Collectively they 
constitute the organism of the school. Since the Sufis be¬ 
lieve in the possibility of communication without physical 
presence, such a concept of a diffused Order is easier for 
the Sufi to accept than it would be for people familiar with 
more conventional views about human society and purpose. 

Branches of Orders exist in guilds, in student bodies, in 
military formations. In more modem times the kind of unit 
represented by the conventional monastery has become the 
exception. The Sufi monastery, outwardly similar in many 
ways to that of the Christian, Hindu or Buddhist, is in 
reality the product of economic and political conditions, 
not of any esoteric necessity. According to the Sufis, “the 
monastery is in the hearts of men.” This, again, is in line 
with the dervish idea that Sufism is a developing entity, 
and cannot remain a system for reproducing forms, how¬ 
ever attractive they may be. 

In places where a feudal type of life still continues, Sufi 
monasteries, tied to the produce of the land, continue to 
flourish. In urban life, Sufi centers are more yoked to the 
tempo of town living, and derive their income from shops 
donated to the community, or from a levy upon the earn¬ 
ings of the members of the Order. 



THE SUFIS 


328 

The Sufi Order, then, stands for the body of people who 
are specializing in the acceptance, using and transmission 
of Sufism. It has no traditional shape, and its outward ap¬ 
pearance will depend upon local conditions and the neces¬ 
sities of the “work.” 

One Arabic publishing company is a Sufi organization. 
In some areas all the industrial and agricultural workers 
are Sufis. Certain professions in some countries are domi¬ 
nated by Sufis. These specialist groupings of Sufis may con¬ 
sider themselves to be Orders or monasteries, engaged in a 
specific task of acceptance, preservation and transmission. 
The central factor in the Orders is, of course, the produc¬ 
tion of the human exemplar of the teaching, as distinct 
from the propagation of the Order or any mechanical pro¬ 
motion in terms of identifiable rank. Sufis have no bishops. 

This is not to say that the hierarchy of Sufis is not well 
defined. But a Sufi is known by another, insofar as rank 
is concerned, by methods other than the displaying of in¬ 
signia. A certain degree of development of the individual, 
in spite of its having to be confirmed by a master, is held 
by Sufis to be perceptible to others of similar attainments. 

It is within the school of the Order that the initial ac¬ 
ceptance and development of the candidate takes place. Un¬ 
like other systems of instruction, there is nothing of the 
nature of conditioning. The aspirant must be attached to 
the principles of the Order and to the person of the teacher, 
but before this can take place he has to be tested. The 
testing is carried out with the intention of shedding those 
individuals who are unsuitable. Rejected are those who feel 
the desire to attach themselves to an organization or individ¬ 
ual because of their own weaknesses. People who have been 
attracted by the repute of Sufis and the desire to attain 
miraculous powers are weeded out. The initial tasks given 
to a probationary member have two main functions—the 
first is to determine his suitability, the second to show him 
that he must desire Sufihood for its own sake. 

Very often the teacher in whose charge the candidate is 


THE DERVISH ORDERS 


3^9 

placed will do all he can to deter him—not by persuasion, 
but by playing a part which may seem to reflect discredit 
upon himself. The Sufis believe that only by these methods 
can they communicate to the essence awaiting to be awak¬ 
ened the fact that the Sufi impulse is available. The nominal 
communication with the outward personality of the can¬ 
didate is relatively unimportant When the mind is not yet 
capable of grasping Sufism coherently, the Sufi will not 
attempt to persuade it. He has to communicate at greater 
depth. People of this sort, who could be convinced by con¬ 
ventional means of the importance of Sufism, would not be 
genuine converts. 

Many of the reports of absurd and unacceptable behavior 
of Sufis stem from the working out of such plans. 

Many of the main Orders have been nicknamed. The 
Rifa'i are called the Howling Dervishes; the Qalandari 
“Shaven”; the Chis(h)ti “Musicians”; the Mevlevi ‘Danc¬ 
ing”; the Naqshbandi “Silent.” 

These Orders are generally named after the founder of 
the specialization which they represent. Rumi, for instance, 
organized his “dances” in accordance with what he con¬ 
sidered to be the best way of developing in his disciples 
the Sufic experiences. This was done, as ancient records 
show, in accordance with the mentality and temperament 
of the people of Konia. Imitators have attempted to export 
the system outside of this cultural area, with the result that 
they are left with what amounts to a pantomime, and the 
original effect of the movements has disappeared. 

The rhythmic (and arhythmic) movements called dance 
are used in many Orders, always in response to the needs 
of the individuals and the group. Sufi movements can thus 
never be stereotyped, and do not constitute what is else¬ 
where called dance, calisthenics or the like. The using of 
movements follows a pattern based upon certain discoveries 
and knowledge which can only be applied by a teaching 
master of a dervish Order. 

It seems likely that the religious dances which are known 



THE SUFIS 


330 

in Christianity, Judaism and even primitive tribes are a 
degeneration of this knowledge, ultimately pressed into the 
service of spectacle, magic or superficial mime. 

“If the scissors are not used daily on the beard, says the 
celebrated Sufi poet Jami, "it will not be long before the 
beard is by its luxuriant growth pretending to be the head.' 
(Eaharistan —Abode of Spring) 

The dervish Order may be looked upon as an organi¬ 
zation with the minimum amount of regulation. Like any 
other body of people associating for a purpose, the rules of 
the Order cease to be operative when this objective has 
been attained. 

The schematic diagrams used by the Orders help to convey 
this idea. The chain circle of the Orders shows how the 
groupings stem from the schools which surrounded certain 
classical teachers. These schools took their inspiration from 
the private assemblies of Mohammed and his close com¬ 
panions. Hence, in one such geometrical chart, the center 
shows the companions Abu Bakr, Ali and Abdul-Aziz the 
Meccan in a circle. Arranged around this are seven smaller 
circles, each one containing the name of a great master. 
The seven main Ways of Sufism, the specializations of 
teaching, emanate from these individuals. 

The dervish Orders all claim the spiritual transmission 
(baraka') from one or more of these masters. It must be 
remembered that since Sufism is not static, the total baraka 
of the founders of Orders is held to interpenetrate all the 
Orders. 

The circular format and interlinking of circles indicates 
this interdependence and movement. In poetry, such au¬ 
thors as Rumi have emphasized this by saying: 'When you 
see two Sufis together, you see both two and twenty 
thousand.” 

The objective of the temporary organism called an Order, 
agreed by all masters, is to provide circumstances in which 
the member can attain the stabilization of his inner being 
comparable or identical with those of the early transmitters. 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 


331 

The motive for creating an Order around a group of 
words, chosen to illustrate certain activities or characteris¬ 
tics of the Order, is obvious. All members know that the 
format is not mystical, but arbitrary. They are, in conse¬ 
quence, unable to attach their emotional side to the em¬ 
blems of the Order. The concentration is thus held upon 
the chain of transmission (the individuals whose substance 
is being contacted). Again, since it is believed that the 
Complete Man (insan-i-Kamil) is both a real individuality 
and also a total part of the essential unity, it is not possible 
for the Sufi to attach himself to a personality alone. He 
knows from the start that his interior powers are being 
guided from one objective to the next. Hence, in the 
austerely pious dervish Orders, there is a fixed succession of 
progress through one individual. The disciple has first to 
attach himself to the teacher. When he has reached the maxi¬ 
mum development possible, the teacher transfers him to 
the reality of the founder of the Order. From here he trans¬ 
fers his consciousness to the substance (the “foot”) of Mo¬ 
hammed, the originator of the doctrine in contemporary 
form. From here he is transferred to the reality of God. 
There are other methods, whose application depends upon 
the character of the school and especially the qualities of 
the personality dealt with. In some exercises the disdple has 
to immerse himself in the consciousness of various other 
teachers, including Jesus and others considered by the Sufis 
to be of their number. 

One of the objects of pilgrimages to the burial places or 
former residences of teachers is to make a contact with this 
reality or substance. In neutral phraseology it could be said 
that the Sufis believe that Sufic activity in producing a Com¬ 
plete Man accumulates a force (substance) which itself is 
capable of alchemicalizing a lesser individual. This is not 
to be confused with the idea of magical power, because the 
power exercised upon the Seeker will operate only insofar 
as his motives are pure and he is purged of selfishness. Fur¬ 
ther, it will act in its own way, and not in a manner which 



THE SUEIS 


332 

can be anticipated by the Seeker. Only his teacher, who 
has traveled the way before, will be able to judge as to what 
effect such an exposure will have. 

Within the Orders, when the disciple has been accepted 
for a training course under a master, he has to be prepared 
for the experiences which his unaltered mind is incapable 
of perceiving . 8 This process, which follows the dissipating 
of conditioning, or automatic thinking, is termed the “acti¬ 
vation of the subtleties.” 

There is no word in English which can be used as a true 
equivalent of the technical term “subtlety.” The original 
word is latifa (plural lataif). It has been rendered “purity 
spot,” “place of illumination,” “center of reality.” In order 
to activate this element it is assigned a theoretical physical 
situation in the body—generally considered to be the center 
where its force or haraka is most strongly evidenced. The 
latifa is theoretically considered to be “an incipient organ 
of spiritual perception.” 

The root in Arabic is from the triliteral grouping LTF. 
From this the terms used in Arabic include the concepts of 
subtlety, gentleness, kindness, gift or favor, delicacy. Hence, 
in the phrase “the gentle sex,” the word rendered as “gen¬ 
tle” is in Arabic derived from this root. 

The disciple has to awaken five lataif, receive illumina¬ 
tion through five of the seven subtle centers of communi¬ 
cation. The method, presided over by the instructor 
(Sheikh), is to concentrate the consciousness upon certain 
areas of the body and head, each area being linked with the 
latifa faculties. 

As each latifa is activated through exercises, the con¬ 
sciousness of the disciple changes to accommodate the 
greater potentialities of his mind. He is breaking through 

3 Nearly a century ago, Jolm P. Brown published his The Dar- 
vishes or Oriental Spiritualism 0867), which has since been one of 
the very few sources for elements of dervish activity available in the 
West. 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 333 

the blindness which makes the ordinary man captive to life 
and being as it ordinarily seems to be. 

In more than one sense, therefore, the activation of 
the centers is producing a new man. Lest the reader un¬ 
consciously link this system with others which may resem¬ 
ble it, we must note that the activation of the lataif is only 
a part of a very comprehensive development, and cannot 
be carried out as an individual study. 

The five centers are named Heart, Spirit, Secret, Mys¬ 
terious and Deeply Hidden. Another one, strictly speaking 
not a latifa at all, is Self, composed of a complex of “selves.” 
This is the totality of what the ordinary (raw) man or 
woman considers his personality. It is characterized by a 
shifting series of moods and personalities whose rapidity of 
movement gives the individual the impression that his con¬ 
sciousness is constant or a unity. It is not in fact so. 

The seventh subtlety is accessible only to those who have 
developed the others, and belongs to the real sage, the 
repository and transmitter of the teaching. 

The illumination or activation of one or more of the 
centers may take place partially or accidentally. When this 
happens, the individual may gain for a time a deepening in 
intuitive knowledge corresponding with the latifa involved. 
But if this is not a part of comprehensive development, 
the mind will try, vainly, to equilibrate itself around this 
hypertrophy, an impossible task. The consequences can be 
very dangerous, and include, like all one-sided mental phe¬ 
nomena, exaggerated ideas of self-importance, the surfacing 
of undesirable qualities, or a deterioration of consciousness 
following an access of ability. 

The same is true of breathing exercises or dance move¬ 
ments carried out of correct succession. 

The nonbalanced development produces people who may 
have the illusion that they are seers or sages. Due to the 
inherent power of the latifa , such an individual may appear 
to the world at large to be worthy of following. In Sufi 
diagnosis, this type of personality accounts for a great num- 


THE SUBIS

ber of false metaphysical teachers. They may, of course, 
themselves be convinced that they are genuine. This is 
because the habit of self-deception or of deceiving others 
has not been transmuted. Rather has it been supported and 
magnified by the awakening but still undirected new organ, 
the latifa. 

The areas which are involved in the activation of the 
lataif are: Self, under the navel; Heart, at the place of the 
physical heart; Spirit, on the side of the body opposite 
the heart position. The Secret latifa is exactly between the 
Heart and Spirit positions. Mysterious is in the forehead; 
Deeply Hidden is in the brain. 

The actual meanings of these locations is something 
which comes as a special realization to the Sufi when the 
latifa in question is being activated. It is only at the outset 
of the study that they are given these locations. 

In the dervish schools there is the special interchange 
between the teacher and the learner-something which can¬ 
not rakp place unless there is a real teacher present in the 
community, and until other conditions are ready for the 
interchange. In this, of course, Sufism differs from a philoso¬ 
phy or a practice which can be learned at second hand. 

The special interchange includes the technique called 
tajalli— irradiation. Tajalli influences and affects everyone, 
though it is perceptible only to a few. A person, for 
instance, may find that he is “in luck or does just the 
right thing,” or that he “cannot put a foot wrong.” This 
may be a consequence of accidental tajalli . Not realizing 
the source of the phenomenon, the individual will attribute 
the cause to something else, say to luck. He feels well be¬ 
cause someone has said something complimentary to him; 
or because he has had a raise in pay. These are the rea¬ 
sons, the rationalizations. This, too, is the wasteful form of 
tajalli; because its operation has a content which far exceeds 
in importance and even usefulness the secondary advan¬ 
tages which warm the heart of the unconscious recipient. 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 


335 

Being unconscious of the mechanism, however, he cannot 
proceed further in acquiring the advantages of tajalli. 

The ecstatic condition, when the human being feels him¬ 
self at one with creation, or a Creator, rapture, something 
like intoxication; when he feels that he has entered para¬ 
dise; when all senses interchange or become one sense— 
these can be the inability to accept and participate in tajalli . 
What is considered by the individual to be a blessing is in 
fact a flooding-out of potentiality. It is as if a flood of light 
has been shone into the eyes of someone who was until 
recently blind. It has a glory and a fascination. But it is of 
no use, because it dazzles. 

There is a further stage, when the blindness has been 
removed, and when the personality is wakeful and versatile 
enough to accept tajalli. Then there is the illusion of tajalli, 
sometimes a foretaste, sometimes a reflection, which is use¬ 
ful for artistic creativity or self-indulgence, but is—for the 
Sufi—a fictitious state. This can be easily discerned because 
it is not accompanied by an access of knowledge. It counter¬ 
feits the true state by giving merely a sensation of knowl¬ 
edge or fulfillment. In this respect it resembles a dream in 
which a wish is fulfilled, thus enabling the disturbed 
dreamer to continue with his sleep. If he had not provided 
out of his own mind a happy outcome to his problem he 
would have woken up and delayed the rest function. 

The false tajalli experienced by those who do not carry 
their development along in a balanced way may give rise 
to a conviction that it is a true mystical state, especially 
when it is found that supranormal faculties seem to be 
activated in this condition. Sufis discriminate between this 
experience and the true one in two ways. Firstly, the 
teacher will at once identify the counterfeit state. Secondly, 
as a matter of self-investigation, it can always be discerned 
that the gains of perception are of no exact value. There 
may be, for instance, an access of intuition. One may know 
something about someone—thought reading is an example. 
But the actual function, the value of the ability to read 


336 the sueis 

thought, is nil. The person suffering from false tajalli will 
be able to report some fact or series of facts about someone 
else, indicating a breakthrough of the limitations of time 
and space. The test of the tajalli for anyone who cannot 
instantly recognize that it is genuine is whether the “super¬ 
natural” perception is accompanied by a permanent in¬ 
crease in intuitive knowledge—the seeing of things as a 
whole, for instance; or the knowing of the course which 
one's self-development will take; or the course of that of 
another; or performing “wonders.” Abdul-Qadir Jilani ex¬ 
plains that miracles, which are so often reported of Sufis, 
are not due to any sort of power as generally understood: 
“When you acquire divine knowledge, you are merged with 
the intention of God. . . . Your internal essence admits no 
other thing. . . , People attribute miracles to you. They 
seem to originate with you, but the origin and intention is 
God's.” (Muqala VI of the F utuh el Ghayb ) 

As with other branches of Sufi action, many different 
things have been said and written about the tajalli of the 
subtleties. These only serve as guides, and may be com¬ 
pletely wrong when applied without regard to prevailing 
conditions. For the Sufi, every situation is unique, and 
there are no textbooks as generally understood. 

In spite of this shortcoming, which would deter many 
people from what they consider to be an investigation of 
Sufi illumination, the practice of activating the lataif is 
essential if real progress is to be made. The real teacher 
is he who can nurse his disciples in such a way that the 
awakening of the subtleties takes place concurrently and 
in accordance with what the individual can bear. Give a 
child one sweet, the saying runs, and he will be happy. 
Give hinv a large box of sweets and he will be sick. 

In the stage of activating the lataif the student must first 
recognize the effects of the Self in its myriad facets upon 
his personality. This is something which his teacher intro¬ 
duces to him. Then, almost parallel but a little behind this 
development, he finds the activation of his lataif encouraged 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 337 

by the efforts of the teacher. This is something which he 
cannot start by himself if it is to be successful. 

His first Sufic experience will be associated with the 
illumination of a latifa. Before that stage has been reached, 
he will find that he has to work on himself in the area of 
Selfhood. If he concentrates too much and too long on the 
problem of Selfhood, the master will have greater difficulty 
in encouraging the latifa illumination. In communities 
where this factor is not properly understood, the struggle 
with the Self becomes almost the be-all and end-all of the 
effort. The attachment to the teacher remains, and the 
liberation of the personality cannot be effected. 

It is in this field more than any other that occultists and 
fragmented schools, as well as lone experimenters, go astray 
and in the end peter out or merely become self-propagating 
systems for the self-struggle, without the benefit of the ex¬ 
perience, the tajalli, which tells them that they are capable 
of the development which they seek. In accepting a disciple, 
the master is always careful to assure himself that the former 
has the capacity to progress from self-concentration to latifa - 
release. 

Generally speaking, Sufi doctrines are both studied and 
practiced concurrently in the schools of the dervish Orders. 
This means that there must be a balance between the in¬ 
tellectual presentation and understanding of a doctrine, and 
its application. Further, there must be a balance between 
one set of ideas and another. Concentration as a method of 
doing an exercise is one thing; but it must be balanced by 
the use of nonstruggle absorption of impacts. How this is 
done is a part of the intimate and very effective methodology 
of the dervish Orders. 

Some Orders specialize in certain varieties of technique. 
When a disciple has been taken as far as possible in the 
school of one Order, he may be sent to another one in order 
to give him the elements which are the specialization of 
that school. This, again, has to be done with extreme care, 
because there can be no question of a one-sided develop- 


338 THE SUFIS 

ment If certain faculties are to be developed, this must be 
done in such a way as to leave room for correct and parallel 
development at a later date in another school. 

Among the specializations of the schools are the qiff or 
ist exercise, when a teacher calls out "Halt!” and all physical 
movement is frozen until he allows the students to relax. 
The exercise is carried out by teaching masters of the 
Naqshbandi Order, and it is the Ninth Secret Rule of the 
Order, being a method which has been found to be effec¬ 
tive in breaking through the web of associative thinking 
and making possible the transmission of baraka. 

Something of the atmosphere in a dervish Order’s school 
can be felt by this statement, which is a verbatim extract 
from a preliminary discourse by Sheikh el-Mushaikh 
(Sheikhly Sheikh), addressing a number of candidates for 
admission to the Azamia (Greater) Order recently: 

‘The object of the Sufis is to refine themselves to such an 
extent that they attain the irradiation [anwar] of what we 
call the several attributes of God, or Beautiful Names. No 
Sufi can become a part of the ‘texture of God’ by such an 
ultimate refinement. Yet only by getting rid of his material 
slough can he enliven his true essence, which can be called 
the soul [mh], 

“Your attention is invited to the anecdote reported by 
the Sage Sanai, in his Walled Garden of Truth . In it he 
shows that the superficial perception of religion is inaccu¬ 
rate, so that when I speak of God and Soul and so on, you 
will have to remember that these are things, as Ibn El- 
Arabi stresses, which have no correct parallel to you, and 
which have to be perceived, not merely named and asso¬ 
ciated with emotionalism. 

“The Sage Sanai says: 

“ ‘A man of discernment asked an unreflective one, seeing 
that he was prone to accepting facile assumptions, “Have 
you seen saffron, or only heard of it ?” 9 

“ ‘He answered, “I have seen it, I have eaten it a hundred 
times (in tinted rice) and more.” * 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 339 

Said the Sage, “Bravo, unfortunate one! Do you know 
that it grows from a bulb? Can you continue to talk like 
this? Does he who is ignorant of himself know the soul of 
another? He who knows hand and foot, how can he know 
divinity? . • . When you experience, then you will know 
the meaning of belief. . . , The scholarly are entirely mis¬ 
directed." ' 

"To continue. Inasmuch as the accretions weigh down 
the inner spark [ruh] of the Seeker and thus prevent his 
progress toward completeness, for the scaling off of these 
accretions certain exercises have to be performed. They 
have to be in accordance with the needs of the Seeker. Ex¬ 
actly how this is done is dependent upon the action and 
knowledge of a Special Guide [murshid or pit, Guided One 
or Ancient, Wise One]. Some have the impression that this 
enlightenment can be attained by a Seeker ( saliK) by read¬ 
ing books on Sufism, and by practices of his own. This is 
neither theoretically sound nor borne out by experience, 
quite apart from our inner cognition of its falsity. A Guide 
is absolutely essential. 

“Certain terms have to be noted. Nafs in Sufic terminol¬ 
ogy is both ego and ‘breath/ How the word is used is im¬ 
portant and comes through attention to its use in actual 
fact, not by a study of dictionaries. It is often said that the 
nafs-d-ammara (Commanding Self) has to be subdued. This 
may mean that certain cravings and physical and mental 
attitudes have to be seen for what they are and treated 
accordingly. In this usage, the word is seen to mean self or 
ego. In another usage, it simply means breath. For example, 
in the exercise known as habsd-dam it means ‘imprisoning 
the breath/ under the strict supervision of a Guide, who 
uses this exercise for a specific and limited purpose. 

“The word bayat means taking the pledge, pact engage¬ 
ment or undertaking, and it signifies the occasion when 
the Seeker places his hands between those of the Spiritual 
Guide for the dual pledge. One, on his part, binds himself 
to seek the Way indicated by the Guide. The other, on his 



340 the sufis 

own part, undertakes to guide the Seeker on the Path. This 
is a special, solemn, meaningful moment There is a dual, 
mutual interaction in the pledge; a contractual relationship 
is formalized by it. It is at this juncture that the Seeker 
may be allowed to call himself murid (disciple). Directed 
One. 

"The term muraqiba covers forms of concentration. In it 
the disciple strives to remove certain thoughts from his mind 
and concentrate upon things which will make possible his 
illumination and lay a basis for his permanency. The term 
also corresponds with sitting with the head down, chin on 
knee, the correct Sufi posture. 

“The word ztkr Qdhikr in Arabic) literally means repeti¬ 
tion or recital. It conveys the action of the disciple repeating 
as many times as directed that which he has been given to 
repeat. It is also, in another sense, called wird. 

"The technical term tajalli, luminizing, and the word 
nur (light—plural: anwar) are both associated with the 
process of activating which is carried out on the way to¬ 
ward independent reality through the force contained in 
the power of Love. In this we work with the Beautiful 
Names. Generally considered to be ninety-nine in number, 
corresponding to the number of beads on a Sufi rosary, they 
are in another sense limitless. In active 'work* they are 
limited at first to the names or concepts which are needed to 
help activate the special organs of perception and commu¬ 
nication. 

"There is no point at all in activating special new organs 
of perception and communication unless the individual at 
the same time is able to keep up with the realization of what 
is being communicated, to whom, and why. The improve¬ 
ment of communication in itself is best limited to spheres 
where it belongs—among intellectuals who assume that they 
have something to communicate. For the rest of us, present 
methods are adequate to ordinary purposes. 

"The word qalb (heart) may be considered an anatomi¬ 
cal localization of the organ which has to be awakened. 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 


341 

Its position is where the pulsation of the physical heart is 
normally to be determined on the left breast. In Sufi belief 
and action, this organ is considered to be the seat of the 
main, initial inner perceptiveness involved in the ‘search* 
or ‘work/ 

“The total illumination of this and certain other organs 
precedes the walayat-i-Kubra (major saintship), which is 
the goal of the Sufi and which corresponds, in other sys¬ 
tems, with illumination. At this stage there are certain 
powers available, powers which seemingly control natural 
phenomena. It must be remembered that miraculous powers 
relate to a sphere in which they are coherent and meaning¬ 
ful, and cannot be examined from the viewpoint of the 
sensationmonger. 

“The unification which the Sufi attains is termed fana 
(annihilation). Self-mortification is not permitted, and the 
proper physical upkeep of the body is essential. 

“Before the exercises can take place, either the Greater 
Balance or the Lesser Balance must have been achieved by 
the candidate. This balance is connected with the fact that 
ordinary humanity is not able, except for very short periods, 
to concentrate at all. Rumi, in Fihi Ma Fihi, stresses this, a 
matter of first importance in any teaching situation: 

Innumerable changes of mood are yours, and they are 
uncontrolled by you. If you knew their origin, you 
would be able to dominate them. If you cannot localize 
your own changes, how can you localize that which 
formed you? 

“A great deal of Sufi poetry, in addition to its formal 
content, refers to degrees of wholeness or ability to con¬ 
centrate the mind and as a result find a way to the place 
where truth is not fragmented. When Shabistari in the 
Secret Garden speaks of a spark being whirled and giving 
a mere illusion that it is constituting a circle of light, he is 
speaking of a Sufi experience, known to all dervishes, of a 
certain stage of collection/ ” 



THE SOTIS 


342 

The dervish belief, as affirmed in the practices of the 
working Orders (as distinct from repetitiously devout ones 
which specialize in saint worship), is that there is a special 
state which has to be activated. This is not emotional, cer¬ 
tainly not intellectual as ordinarily experienced. The fre¬ 
quent references to refining, purifying and discriminating 
are connected with this. The dervish refines his conscious¬ 
ness so that he can become aware of states of mind and 
conditions of reality which are only crudely grasped by the 
ordinary mind. It might be said that people are normally 
aware of intellect only in terms of quantity; of emotion 
as a quantity. The quality, a subtler side which is nonethe¬ 
less essential to completeness, is difficult to train or elicit, 
hence abandoned by most people, who make do with very 
rough approximations of their total capacities. 

And, of course, perception of these infinite subtleties is 
not possible to the ordinary individual. Just as a child has 
to learn to distinguish between objects in terms of coarse 
and fine, so has the unregenerate human perception to be 
trained in this respect. 

The full dynamic of the Organ of Evolution becomes 
operative only when something akin to detachment has 
been attained. This happens only when certain educational 
preparations have been made. Before the stage of conscious 
development, various indisputable experiences mark certain 
stages of advance. These give the individual both proof of 
his progress and strength to continue to the next stage. Un¬ 
less he receives these illuminations in correct succession, he 
will stay at a stage of partial awareness or occasional con¬ 
centration power. One of the least desirable results of such 
out-of-sequence development is when the candidate is not 
weaned from dependence upon his instructor. 

When what we have called the Organ of Evolution is 
developed and working, the functions of instinct, emotion 
and intellect are transmuted and work in a new key. A 
fresh and ever-widening series of experiences is open to 
the dervish. 



343 


THE DERVISH ORDERS 

Infinite possibilities and intricate mechanisms are now 
seen in things which formerly seemed inert or of limited 
use. A dervish example is found in the teaching reference to 
the permissibility of listening to music. The great Shibli 
says: ‘Hearing music deliberately seems outwardly to be a 
disruptive thing; internally it is a warning. When the Sign 
is known, such a person may listen, for he hears the warn¬ 
ing. Unless he has the Sign (awakening of the Organ of 
Evolution), he is submitting himself to the possibility of 
danger.” The sensual nature of music is here referred to, 
as well as the mere emotional and limited intellectual value 
of music. These are dangers, both because they may lead 
to sensuality and because, through producing a taste for the 
secondary indulgence (music because one enjoys music), it 
veils the real usefulness of music, which is to develop the 
consciousness. 

This is a sense of music which is not only unknown in 
the West, but energetically denied by many people in the 
East. Because of the peculiarities of music, some dervish 
Orders, especially the powerful and highly adaptable 
Naqshbandi Order, refuse to employ it. 

Also a specialization of dervish schools is the real value 
of poetry, employed as a mystical exercise. All poetry has 
several functions. In accordance with its “reality,” so will it 
be meaningful for the Sufi. All Orders allow on theological 
grounds the hearing of poetry, because Mohammed the 
Prophet approved of it. He said, “Some poetry is wisdom;” 
and “Wisdom is like the lost she-camel of the devout 
Wherever he finds her, he still has the best right to her.” He 
actually used an Arab rhyme to assert what is the Sufi theme 
of a complete reality which is God: “The most true Arab 
statement is in the rhyme by Labid that ‘Everything but 
God is unnecessary, for events change/ ” 

When he was asked to comment on poetry, the Prophet 
replied, “What is good of it is good, and what is bad, is bad.” 
This is the dictum followed by Sufi masters regarding the 
permissibility of hearing, reading or writing poetry. 



THE SUEIS 


344 

But, according to the great teacher Hujwiri, poetry must 
in its essence be real and true. If there is unreality or un¬ 
truth in it, it will contaminate the hearer, reader and writer 
with its faults. 

The manner in which poetry is heard, and the ability of 
the hearer to benefit from it, is important to Sufism. The 
dervish teachers will not allow that the real essence of 
poetry can be appreciated by those who are not correctly 
prepared for its full understanding, however much an in¬ 
dividual may believe that he is extracting the whole from 
hearing a poem. 

Hujwiri passes on the dictum from dervish schools that 
those who are stirred by the hearing of sensual music are 
those who are hearing in a sense which is not real. Real 
hearing, of poetry as of music, is of development value, 
giving a range of experiences far more varied and valuable 
than fleshly or ecstatic ones. This, however, can only be 
enunciated in the present context as an assertion. It is not 
susceptible to verification outside a Sufi circle. 

For the Sufi there are four Journeys. The first of these 
is the attainment of the condition known as fana, sometimes 
translated as "annihilation.” This is the stage of unification 
of the consciousness, in which the Sufi is harmonized with 
objective reality. It is the production of this condition which 
is the objective of the dervish Orders. There are three stages 
after this. Niffari, a great teacher of the tenth century, 
describes the Four Journeys in his Muwaqif, written in 
Egypt nearly a thousand years ago. 

After he has reached the stage of fana, the Sufi passes into 
the Second Journey, in which he truly becomes the Perfect 
Man by the stabilization of his objective knowledge. This is 
the stage of baqa, permanency. He is now not a "God- 
intoxicated man,” but a teacher in his own right. He has 
the title of qutub , magnetic center, "point toward which all 
turn.” 

In the Third Journey, the teacher becomes a spiritual 
director to each kind of person in accordance with that 



THE DERVISH ORDERS 


345 

person's individuality. The previous kind of teacher (of the 
Second Journey) is able to teach only within his own im¬ 
mediate culture or local religion. The third kind of teacher 
may appear to be many different things to different men. 
He is operating on many levels. He is not “all things to all 
men" as part of a deliberate policy. He can, on the other 
hand, benefit everyone in accordance with that person's 
potentiality. The teacher of the Second Journey, in con¬ 
trast, is able to work only with selected individuals. 

In the Fourth, and last, Journey, the Perfect Man guides 
others in their transition from what is generally considered 
to be physical death, to a further stage of development 
which is invisible to the ordinary person. For the dervish, 
therefore, the apparent break which takes place at conven¬ 
tional physical death does not exist. A continuous communi¬ 
cation and interchange exists between him and the next 
form of life. 

In a dervish community, as in ordinary life, the spiritual 
attainments of an individual Sufi may not be apparent 
except to those who are in a position to perceive the emana¬ 
tions of a higher order which truly characterize the dervish. 

It is to these stages which Ghazali refers in his standard 
work, the Ikya. He approaches his description of them from 
the viewpoint of their relevancy to one another and their 
function for the external world. There are, he says, four 
stages, which may be likened to a walnut. The choice of this 
nut is made, incidentally, because in Persian the walnut is 
called the “four-kerneled" which can also be translated as 
“four essences" or “four brains." 

The nut has a hard shell, an inside skin, a kernel and oil. 
The shell, bitter in taste, serves as a covering for a period 
of time. It is thrown away when the kernel is taken out. 
The skin is of more value than the shell, but is still not to 
be compared to the kernel itself. The kernel is the object if 
one is attempting to extract oil. Yet even this inner meat 
contains matter which is rejected in the pressing out of the 
oil. 



THE SUFIS 


34 6 

Although Niffari’s book is well known and much studied 
by scholars, the practical application of his method, and the 
real use of the technical term waqfat which he uses, is 
not to be gleaned from reading alone. Although waqfat is 
associated with the Divine Pause and the Halt exercise 
which enables a man to break through time and space, it is 
a highly complex factor which is only roughly indicated by 
the word used. For example, it also has the quality of a 
luminosity which removes the darkness caused by multiplic¬ 
ity. Multiplicity is caused by accepting secondary phenom¬ 
ena as primary ones, or differentiation as difference. In the 
earliest stages of dervish training it is made clear by ex¬ 
amples and exercises that when one is, for instance, work¬ 
ing with the concept of “fruit," one must not concern one¬ 
self with the immense variety of fruit, but with the essential 
concept. 

The dervish schools, whether they exist in a monastery or 
in a caf 6 of Western Europe, are essentials to Sufism because 
it is in the school situation that such materials as those of 
Niffari are studied and experienced, in accordance with 
the peculiarities of the student and the needs of the social 
clime in which he operates. 

This is why the Sufi development has to take root in a 
certain way in various societies. It cannot be imported. 
Neither can the methods of working suited to tenth-century 
Egypt or Yogic India operate effectively in the West. They 
can naturalize themselves, but in their own way. The lure 
of mystery and of the colorful East has for centuries ob¬ 
scured for the Western mind the fact that it is the human 
development which is aimed at, not the trappings. 



Seeker After Knowledge 


I fear that you will not reach Mecca, 

O Nomad!—For the road which you are 
following leads to Turkestan. 

(Sheikh Saadi, Rose Garden , 
"On the Manners of Dervishes”) 


I was sitting one day in the circle of a Sufi teacher in 
northern India, when a young foreigner was brought in. 
He kissed the hand of the Sheikh and started to talk. For 
three and a half years, he said, he had studied religions, 
mysticism and occultism from books, in Germany, France 
and Britain. He had moved from one society to another, 
looking for something which would lead him to the right 
path. Formal religion did not appeal to him. Collecting all 
the money he could lay his hands on, he journeyed to the 
East, and he had wandered from Alexandria to Cairo, 
from Damascus to Teheran, through Afghanistan, India 
and Pakistan. He had been in Burma and Ceylon, as well 
as in Malaya. In all of these places he had talked to, and 
taken copious notes from, spiritual and religious teachers. 

There was no doubt that he had covered an immense 
amount of ground, physically and otherwise. He wanted to 
join this Sheikh because he wanted to do something practi¬ 
cal, to concentrate upon ideas, to improve himself. And he 


THE SUFIS 


348 

showed every sign of being more than ready to submit him¬ 
self to the discipline of a dervish Order. 

The Sheikh asked him why he rejected all the other 
teachings. There were various reasons, he said; different in 
almost every case. “Tell me some,” said the teacher. 

The great religions, he said, did not seem to go deep 
enough. They concentrated upon dogmas. Dogmas had to 
be accepted before anything else. Zen, as he had met it in 
the West, was out of touch with reality. Yoga required a 
fierce discipline if it were not to be “just a fad.” The cults 
which centered around the personality of one man were 
based upon concentration upon that man. He could not 
accept the principle that ceremony, symbolism and what 
he called mimicry of spiritual truths had any true reality. 

Among such Sufis as he had been able to contact, a 
similar pattern seemed to him to obtain. Some had whole¬ 
hearted discipleship; some used rhythmic movements which 
seemed like mimicry of something to him. Others taught 
through recitals indistinguishable from sermons. Some Sufis 
were wedded to concentration upon theological themes. 

Would the Sheikh help him? 

“More than you know,” said the Sheikh. “Man is develop¬ 
ing, whether he knows it or not. Life is one, though in 
some forms it appears inert. While you live, you are learning. 
Those who learn through deliberate effort to learn are 
cutting down on the learning which is being projected 
upon them in the normal state. Uncultivated men often 
have wisdom to some degree because they, allow the access 
of the impacts of life itself. When you walk down the street 
and look at things or people, these impressions are teaching 
you. If you try actively to learn from them, you learn cer¬ 
tain things, but they are predetermined things. You look at 
a man’s face. As you look at it questions arise in your mind, 
and they are answered by your own mind. Is he dark, is he 
fair? What sort of a man is he? There is also a constant 
interchange between the other person and yourself. 

“This interchange is dominated by your subjectivity. By 



SEEKER AFTER KNOWLEDGE

that I mean that you are seeing what you want to see. This 
has become an automatic action; you are like a machine, 
but also a man, only superficially trained. You look at a 
house. The general and particular characteristics of that 
house are split up into smaller elements and assessed in your 
brain. But not objectively—only in accordance with your 
past experiences. These experiences in modern man include 
what he has been told. Thus the house will be big or small, 
nice or not so nice; like your own or not like it. In greater 
detail, it will have a roof like another, it will have windows 
which are unusual. The machine is going around in circles, 
because it is merely adding to its formal knowledge.” 

The newcomer looked dazed. 

“What I am trying to convey,” said the Sheikh, relent¬ 
lessly, “is that you assess things in accordance with precon¬ 
ceived ideas. This is almost inevitable for the intellectual 
man. You do not like symbolism in religion, you have de¬ 
cided. Very well, you will seek a religion without symbol¬ 
ism.” He paused. “Is that what you mean?” 

“I think I mean that the use of symbolism by various 
bodies does not satisfy me as being genuine or necessary,” 
said the youth. 

“Does that mean that you would know if you found a 
form of using symbols which was correct?” queried the

Symbolism and ritual, to me, are not fundamental,” re¬ 
plied the would-be disciple, “and it is fundamentals that I 
seek.” 

“Would you recognize a fundamental if you saw one?” 

“I think so.” 

“Then the things which we say and do would seem to you 
to be mere matters of opinion, or tradition, or superficiality; 
because we do use symbols. Others use chants, and move¬ 
ments, and thinking and silence, concentration and con¬ 
templation—a dozen other things.” The Sheikh paused. 

The visitor spoke. 

“Do you think the exclusivity of Judaism, the rituals of 


THE SOTIS 


350 

Christianity, the fasting in Islam, the Buddhist shaven head, 
to be fundamentals?” Our guest was now wanning up to a 
characteristic intellectual theme. 

‘The Sufi dictum is that the 'apparent is the bridge to 
the Real/ ” said the Sheikh. "This means, in the case which 
we are considering, that all these things have a meaning. 
The meaning may be lost, the performance a mere mockery, 
a sentimental or misunderstood acting of a part. But, 
properly used, they are connected in a continuous sense with 
the true reality.” 

"So originally all ritual is meaningful and has a neces¬ 
sary effect?” 

"Essentially all ritual, symbolism and so on is a reflection 
of a truth. It may have been concocted, adapted, diverted 
to other ends; but it represents a truth—the inner truth of 
what we call the Sufi Way.” 

"But the practitioners do not know what it means?” 

"They may know in one sense, on one level; a level suf¬ 
ficiently deep to propagate the system. But as far as reach¬ 
ing reality and self-development, the use of these techniques 
is nil.” 

"Then,” said the student, "how do we know who is using 
the outward signs in the right way, the way of development, 
and who is not? I can accept that these superficial indica¬ 
tions are of potential value, inasmuch as they could lead to 
something else, and we have to start somewhere. But I, for 
one, could not tell you which system I should follow.” 

"A moment ago you were applying for admission to our 
circle,” said the Sheikh, "and now I have succeeded in con¬ 
fusing you to such an extent that you admit you cannot 
judge. Well, that is the essence of it. You cannot judge. You 
cannot use the instruments of carpentry for watchmaking. 
You have set yourself a task: to find spiritual truth. You 
have sought this truth in the wrong directions, and inter¬ 
preted its manifestations in the wrong way. Is it surprising 
that you will remain in this state? There is one other al¬ 
ternative for you, as you are at present. The excessive con- 



SEEKER AFTER KNOWLEDGE 


351 

centration upon the theme, the anxiety and emotion which 
is engendered in you, will ultimately pile up to such an 
extent that you will seek a relief from it. Then what will 
happen? Emotion will swamp intellect; and you will either 
hate religion or—more likely—become converted to some 
cult which takes the responsibility. You will settle down 
with the notion that you have found what you sought.” 

“Is there no other alternative, even assuming that I ac¬ 
cept your belief that my emotion can swamp my intellect?” 
The intellectual training does not take kindly to any sug¬ 
gestion that it is not comprehensive; nor that it can be 
swamped by emotion. The slight asperity in tone showed 
that the thinker was asserting itself. This was not lost on 
the Sheikh. 

'The alternative, which you will not take, is detachment. 
You see, when we detach, we do not do so in the way in 
which you do. Intellect teaches you to detach your mind 
from something and view it intellectually. What we have 
to do is to detach from both intellect and emotion. How can 
you become accessible to anything if you are using intellect 
to judge it? Your problem is that what you call intellect 
is really a series of ideas which alternately take possession of 
your consciousness. We do not regard intellect as sufficient. 
Intellect, for us, is a complex of more or less compatible 
attitudes which you have been trained to regard as one sin¬ 
gle thing. According to Sufi thinking, there is a level below 
this, which is a single, small, but vital one. It is the true 
intellect. This true intellect is the organ of comprehension, 
existing in every human being. From time to time in ordi¬ 
nary human life it breaks through, producing strange 
phenomena which cannot be accounted for by the usual 
methods. Sometimes these are called occult phenomena, 
sometimes they are thought to be a transcending of the time 
or space relationship. This is the element in the human 
being which is responsible for his evolution to a higher 
form.” 

“And I have to take this on trust?” 



THE SUEIS 


352 

“No, you cannot take it on trust, even if you wanted to 
do so. If you took it on trust, you would soon abandon it* 
Even if you were intellectually convinced that it was neces¬ 
sary as a hypothesis, you might very well lose it* No, you 
have to experience it. This means, of course, that you have 
to feel it in a way which you feel nothing else. It comes 
into your consciousness as a truth different in quality from 
other things which you have been accustomed to regarding 
as truths. By its very difference you recognize that it belongs 
to the area which we call ‘the other/ ” 

Our visitor found this difficult to digest, and returned to 
his established way of thinking. “Are you trying to produce 
in me a conviction that there is something deeper, and that 
I feel it? Because if not, I do not see the point of spending 
so much time on this discussion.” 

“You will think it very rude of me, I am sure,” said the 
Sheikh amiably, “but I have to say that things are not as you 
see them. You see, you come here and talk. I talk to you. As 
a consequence of our talk and thought many things hap¬ 
pen. As far as you are concerned, all that has happened is 
that we have talked. You may feel that you are convinced, 
or you are not. To us the meaning of the whole event 
is far greater. Something is happening as a result of this 
talk. It is happening, as you can well imagine, in the minds 
of all the people here. But something else is also happening 
—to you, to me, and elsewhere. Something which you under¬ 
stand when you understand it Take it on the very simple 
level of cause and effect as normally understood. A man goes 
into a shop and buys a piece of soap. As a result of this 
purchase, many things can happen—the shopkeeper has that 
much more money, more soap may be ordered, and so on. 
Words spoken in the course of the transaction have an 
effect, depending upon the condition of mind of the two 
parties. When the man leaves the shop, there is an additional 
factor in his life that was not there before—the soap. Many 
things can happen as a result of this. But to the two main 
characters, all that has redly happened is that a piece of 



SEEKER AFTER KNOWLEDGE 353 

soap has been bought and paid for. They have no awareness 
of the ramifications of this, and little interest in it. It is only 
when something noteworthy—from their point of view—hap¬ 
pens that they think about it again. Then, they will say, 
Taney that, the man who bought my soap was a murderer;' 
or perhaps he was a king. Or perhaps he left a counterfeit 
coin. Every action, like every word, has an effect and a place. 
This is the basis of the Sufi system-without-a-system. And, 
as you will have read in innumerable stories, the Sufi moves 
among the incredible complex of actions and happenings 
in a state of inner awareness of their meaning." 

“I can see what you mean," said the visitor, 'Tut I cannot 
experience it. If it is true, of course it accounts for quite a 
number of things. Some occult happenings; prophetic ex¬ 
periences; the failure of all but a very few people to solve 
riddles of life by merely thinking about them. And it could 
also mean that a person who is aware of the complex devel¬ 
opments all around him can harmonize himself with them 
to a degree impossible to others. But the price of trying this 
is the price of throwing away one's previous knowledge. I 
could not do that." 

The Sheikh did not want a verbal victory, and did not 
close in for a coup de grdee. "My friend, a man once hurt 
his leg. He had to walk with a crutch. This crutch was 
very useful to him, both for walking and for many other 
purposes. He taught all his family to use crutches, and they 
became a part of normal life. It was a part of everyone's 
ambition to have a crutch. Some were made of ivory, others 
adorned with gold. Schools were opened to train people in 
their use, university chairs endowed to deal with the higher 
aspects of this science. A few, a very few people started to 
walk without crutches. This was considered scandalous, 
absurd. Besides, there were so many uses for crutches. 
Some of them replied, and were punished. They tried to 
show that a crutch could be used sometimes, when needed. 
Or that many of the uses to which a crutch was put could 
be supplied in other ways. Few listened. In order to over- 



354 


THE SUEIS 


come the prejudices, some of the people who could walk 
without support began to behave in a way totally different 
from established society. Still they remained a few. 

‘When it was found that, having used crutches for so 
many generations, few people could in fact walk without 
crutches, the majority ‘proved’ that they were necessary. 
‘Here/ they said, Tiere is a man. Try to make him walk 
without a crutch. See? He cannot/ ‘But we are walking 
without crutches/ the ordinary walkers reminded them. 
This is not true; merely a fancy of your own/ said the 
cripples—because by that time they were becoming blind as 
well; blind because they would not see/’ 

“The analogy does not fit completely," said the young 
man. 

“Does any analogy fit completely?" asked the Sheikh. 
“Don’t you see that if I could explain everything easily and 
completely, by means of a single story, there would be no 
need for this talk? Only partial truths are expressed exactly 
by analogy. For instance, I can give you a perfect pattern 
for a circular disc, and you can cut out thousands from it. 
Each one may be a duplicate of each other one. But, as we 
all know, a circle is only relatively circular. Increase its di¬ 
mensions proportionately by several hundred times, and 
you will find that it is not a true circle any more." 

“This is a fact of physical science; I know that all 
scientific laws are only relatively true. This is all that 
science itself claims." 

“And yet you seek complete truth through relative 
methods?" 

“Yes, and so do you, because you said that symbols and so 
on are ‘bridges to the real/ though they are incomplete " 

“The difference is that you have chosen one single 
method of approaching truth. This is not enough. We use 
many different methods, and we recognize that there is a 
truth which is perceived by an inner organ. You are trying 
to boil water, and you do not know how. We boil water by

bringing together certain elements—the fire, the container, 
the water.” 

“But what about my intellect?” 

“That must fall into its right perspective, find its own 
level, when the present lack of balance of the personality 
is restored.” 

When the visitor had left, someone asked the sage, ‘Will 
you comment upon this interview?” 

“If I comment upon it,” he said, “it would lose its perfec¬ 
tion.” 

We had all learned, each in accordance with his status. 

The Sufi doctrine of equipoise between extremes has 
several meanings. Where it applies to discipleship, the 
capacity to learn from another, it means that the individual 
must be free from incorrect thinking before he can start 
to learn. Our Western would-be disciple has to learn that he 
cannot bring his assumptions about his own capacity to 
learn into a field where he does not in fact know what it is 
that he is trying to learn. All he really knows is that he is 
in some way dissatisfied. All the rest is his own collection 
of ideas as to what the reason for the dissatisfaction might 
be, and an attempt to find a cure for the illness which he 
has diagnosed without first asking himself about his diag¬ 
nostic abilities. 

We have chosen an actual incident involving a Westerner; 
but this form of thinking is not confined to the West. 
Similarly, the opposite extreme—the man who wants to sub¬ 
mit himself completely to the will of a master—which is 
said to be characteristic of the Eastern mind, is next to use¬ 
less. The Seeker must first attain some measure of balance 
between these two extremes before he can be said to have 
the capacity to learn. 

Both types learn about their capacity to learn mainly from 
the observation of the Sufi teacher and his way of behaving. 
As the human exemplar, his doings and sayings are the 
bridge between the relative incapacity of the student and 
the position of being a Sufi. Less than one person in a hun- 


356 THE SUFIS 

dred will normally have any conception of either of these 
two requirements. If the student, by careful study of Sufi 
literature, does glimpse the principle upon which disciple- 
ship works, he will be more than fortunate. 

He can find it in Sufic material, providing that he is 
prepared to read and reread it, to school himself to avoid 
the automatic associations which pigeonhole or label Sufi 
(and all other) thought for him. Generally speaking, he 
is more likely to be temporarily attracted to some more plau¬ 
sible school, which lays down inflexible principles which 
he can lean upon. 



The Creed, of Love 


One went to the door of the Beloved and knocked* 

A voice asked, “Who is there?” 

He answered, “It is I." 

The voice said, “There is no room for Me and Thee.” 
The door was shut* 

After a year of solitude and deprivation he returned and 
knocked. 

A voice from within asked, “Who is there?” 

The man said, “It is Thee." 

The door was opened for him. 

(Jalaluddin Rump 


Sufism has often been called the creed of love. All Sufis, ir¬ 
respective of the external appearance of their schools, have 
made this theme a matter of essential concern. The analogy 
of human love as a reflection of real truth, so often expressed 
in Sufi poetry, has often been literally interpreted by others 
than Sufis. When Rumi says: “Wherever you are, whatever 
your condition is, always try to be a lover," he is not speaking 
of love as an end in itself; nor of human love as the ultimate 
possibility in the potential of the human being. 

The deterioration of the Sufic love-ideal in the West is 
seen to develop fairly after the loss of a linguistic grasp of 
the word groupings adopted by Sufi teachers to convey the 
fact that their idea of love was much more than idyllic 
fantasy. Spreading from Spain and southern France into 
western Europe, undergoing a change of language which 
robbed it of its effective content, the creed of love lost many 
of , its essential characteristics. In order to recapture, for a 
Western audience, the comprehensive nature of this Sufic

specialization, we have to look at the development of the 
troubadors. 

One aspect of love poetry arising in Saracen Spain, that 
of the elevation of womankind, was rapidly diverted by the 
Church, as has been noted by historians, into the idealiza¬ 
tion of the Virgin Mary. This development is seen in the 
collection of poetry made by Alfonso the Sage from Saracen 
sources. An authority on this subject freezes this moment 
for us in referring to these Cantigas de Santa Maria: "The 
subject—the praise of the Virgin Mary—is a logical develop¬ 
ment of the troubadors idealization of the lady of the manor; 
while the poems of the troubadors . . . are, in matter, form 
and style closely connected with Arabic idealism and 
Arabic poetry written in Spain .” 1 

Professor Hitti and others are fully persuaded of the Arab 
origins of the troubadors: ‘The troubadors . . . resembled 
Arab singers not only in sentiment and character but 
also in the very forms of their minstrelsy. Certain titles 
which these Provencal singers gave to their songs are but 
translations from Arabic titles .” 2 

The derivation of the word "troubador” from the romance 
word for "finding” is a secondary one. They were "finders” 
in the sense that this was the nearest applicable naturaliza¬ 
tion of the original term, which is an Arabic word, itself 
a play between two words. The first is RBB (viol), used by 
Sufi minstrels, and applied by both Khayyam and Rumi to 
themselves, as Professor Nicholson has pointed out . 8 The 
second is the root TRB. There is a third, associated sound, 
RB—which literally means, when transformed into RaBBat, 
‘lady, mistress, female idol.” 

As shown again and again in this book, Sufi names for 
specialist groups were invariably chosen with the greatest 
possible care and regard for the poetic niceties of the situa-

xxxvi et seq. 



THE CREED OE LOVE 


359 

tion. We should remember that the “-ador” part of the word 
is merely the Spanish agental suffix, and is no part of the 
original concept. 

Following up the dictionary derivations of the RB and 
TRB roots, if used to describe the activities of a group of 
people, we find ten main derivative words: 

1. TaraBaB = to perfume, rear a child. 

2. RaBBa = to collect, rule people, have authority 

over. 

3. TaRaBBaB = to claim mastership. 

4. RaBB = the Lord, God, Master. 

5. RaBBat = lady, mistress, female idol. 

6. RiBAB = covenant, friends, tithes. 

7. MaRaB = gatherer, abode, meeting place. 

8. MaRaBBaB = preserve, confection. 

9. MuTriB = musician, Sufi exponent, teacher, 

guide. 4 

10. RaBAB = viol, adjective for Sufi singer used by 
Rumi, Khayyam, etc. 

Seen in the light of Sufic usage, therefore, we are not deal¬ 
ing with a phenomenon of Arab minstrelsy, but with the 
efforts of a group of Sufi teachers, in which the love theme 
was a part of a whole. The idealization of woman or the 
playing of the viol are insignificant but nonetheless partial 
aspects of the whole. 

The teachings of Sufi schools contain all the elements col¬ 
lected in the special name of troubador. Sufis gather to¬ 
gether at a meeting place. Some live in convents (RaBAT), 
still commemorated in such Spanish place names as the Ar- 
rdbida, Rabida, Rapita, Rabeda of today. They call them¬ 
selves, and are called, “lovers,” and also “masters.” Al¬ 
though masters, they are also, as they frequently emphasize, 
“slaves of love.” They play the viol, and use a certain 
password containing the two alliterative words for “confec-

tion w and “beloved” to emphasize or commemorate that the 
name of the group has several distinct yet allied meanings. 
The phrase could roughly be translated as *be a darling 
(RB) and pass the jam (RB) .” They speak of divinity as 
female, idol, mistress. Ibn El-Arabi Cthe “greatest master of 
the Sufis), the Spaniard, used this imagery to such a degree 
that he was accused of blasphemy. 

The troubadors are a derivation from a Sufic movement 
originally grouped around their name, which stuck to them 
after its many facets were forgotten. The Arabs ruled Spain 
from the early part of the eighth century, and flourishing 
Sufi schools are noted during the ninth century. The first 
Provencal poets wrote at the end of the eleventh century. 
The correspondence between troubador feeling, however 
diluted a form of the Sufi stream it became, and original 
Sufi material was noted even by people who had no 
specialist knowledge of the interior contact. Emerson 
equates the great Sufi love poet Hafiz and the troubadors, 
and claims for them the true essence of poetry: “Read Hafiz 
and the trouvires: fact books which all geniuses prize as 
raw material and as an antidote to verbiage and false 
poetry.” 

That there was something deeper than the superficial ap¬ 
pearance about the troubadors was noted by Robert Graves 
in The White Goddess. Writing at a time when he had not 
investigated Sufism to any extent, he realized that there had 
been a process at work in the poetry which had altered its 
original sense and direction: 

“Fancy played a negligible part in the development of the 
Greek, Latin and Palestinian myths, or of the Celtic myths 
until the Norman-French trouveres worked them up into 
irresponsible romances of chivalry. They are all grave 
records of ancient religious customs or events, and reliable 
enough as history once their language is understood and 
allowance has been made for errors in transcription, mis-

understandings or obsolete ritual, and deliberate changes 
introduced for moral or political reasons.” 5 

In order to orientate ourselves, to taste the atmosphere of 
those days when Sufi thinking through poetry and music 
was providing a leaven to Western thought which is still 
with us, we can turn to Michelet, the French medievalist. 6 

"The darkness of scholastic Christianity is being replaced 
by the light and warmth of Saracen life, in spite of the 
eclipse of its military power,” he says. The picture which 
he draws for us shows very clearly the effect of Sufi, not 
"Arab” thinking. This passage might almost have been de¬ 
signed for the purpose. Its very existence underlines 
Michelet's intuitive sense of an underlying process, just as 
much as Emerson and Graves, the poets, feel the Sufi im¬ 
pulse in Hafiz and the troubadors. 

He tells us, for instance, that Dante and St. Thomas 
Aquinas look upon Satan in one of two ways—the Christian 
way, "grotesque and coarse-minded . . . such as he was in 
his earliest days, when Jesus could still drive him to enter 
into the herd of swine.” And the other (the Sufi way) as 
"a subtle reasoner, a scholastic theologian, a phrasemonger¬ 
ing jurist.” This latter view is again and again insisted upon 
by the Sufis: "Seek the real Satan in the scholastic sophist, 
or the hairsplitting doctor—for he is the opposite of Truth.” 

The second trend emphasized by Michelet as a legacy 
of Islam to the West—a new realization of love, maternity, 
art, color, verve—is strongly marked in the ideas and 
activities of the Sufis, not the austere scholastics of Moslem 
Spain who in 1106-43 burned publicly the books of Ghazali, 
one of the greatest Sufis: 

"From Asia, that men thought they had abolished, rises 
a new dawn of incomparable splendor, whose rays strike far, 
very far, until they pierce the heavy mists of the West Here 
is a world of nature and art that brute ignorance had called

accursed, but which now starts forth to conquer its con¬ 
querors in a peaceful war of love and maternal charm. All 
men yield to its spell; all are fascinated, and will have 
nothing that is not from Asia. The Orient showers her 
wealth upon us; the webs and the shawls, and carpets of 
exquisite softness and cunningly blended colors of her looms, 
the keen, flashing steel of her damascened blades, convince 
us of our own barbarism. ... Is there one being of sanity 
strong enough, where sanity is so rare, to receive all this 
without giddiness, without intoxication. ... Is there a 
brain that not being petrified, crystallized in the barren 
dogmas of Aquinas, is still free to receive life, and the vigor¬ 
ous sap of life? Three Wizards essay the task (Albertus 
Magnus, Roger Bacon, Arnold of Vallaneuve) by innate 
vigor of mind they force their way to Nature's source; but 
bold and intrepid as their genius is, it has not, it cannot 
have, the adaptability, the power, of the popular spirit. ,&gt; 

The Sufi stream was partially dammed. The West 
accepted the bases of much luxury, love poetry and the en¬ 
joyment of living. Certain elements, necessary to the whole 
and impossible without a human exemplar of the Sufi Way, 
remained almost unknown. The Sufi Guide, in his dis¬ 
torted form of a mysterious near-occultist figure, lingered on 
in strange places. He was for the most part someone heard 
about, not met. 

Centuries later, reaching back toward the sources of the 
love cult which had shaped his own Western heritage, no 
less a personage than Professor Nicholson, the great scholar, 
himself composed a Sufic verse: 

Love, Love alone can kill what seemed dead. 

The frozen snake of passion. Love alone 
By tearful prayers and fiery longing fed, 

Reveals a knowledge schools have never known. 7 

Such was the vitality of the inner Sufic theme of this 
poetry that it laid the foundation of a great deal of sub-

sequent Western literature. As one writer puts it: "Without 
the Provencal and troubador singers there would be precious 
little in our contemporary music worth the name. True, we 
could have had dirges and folk songs, but the strange in¬ 
sistent call to something else, something which awaits us, 
something which as human beings we have to accomplish, 
would probably be missing from poetry and music alike." 8 

Sufi transmission, in however attenuated a form, must be 
considered to be a basic ingredient of modem life. This is 
not to say that its goals are understood today, because the 
tradition as known in the West is necessarily incomplete. 
The greatest authority upon the Arabs, Professor Philip 
Hitti, regards this Provencal and troubador transmission as 
marking a new civilization for the West: 

"In southern France the first Provencal poets appear full- 
fledged toward the end of the eleventh century with palpi¬ 
tating love expressed in a wealth of fantastic imagery. The 
troubadors (TaRaB: music, song) who flourished in the 
twelfth century imitated their southern contemporaries, the 
zajcd singers. Following the Arabic precedent the cult of the 
dame suddenly arises in southwest Europe. The Chanson de 
Roland, the noblest monument of early European literature, 
whose appearance prior to 1080 marks the beginning of a 
new civilization—that of Western Europe—just as the 
Homeric poems mark the beginning of historic Greece, owes 
its existence to a military contact with Moslem Spain." 9 

European music as we know it today was transformed by 
this development from Sufi sources. 10

this same period a new principle appears in Christian European music,

The association between love and poetry, between the 
poet and the musician, and between these and the magician 
in the widest sense, runs through Sufism, as through the 
Western tradition which it undoubtedly contacted and rein¬ 
forced. It is as if the twin streams of the ancient teaching 
mingle on this dimension, far removed from the coldly 
rationalizing intellect. The object of the poet-lover-magician 
is not, however, in Sufism, merely to be absorbed in the 
effulgence of the truth which he learns. He is transformed 
by it, and as a consequence has a social function—to inject 
back into the stream of life the direction which humanity 
needs in order to fulfill itself. This is the role of the "secret 
garden” experience beyond which comes the understanding 
of the poet’s mission. Florence Lederer grasps this sense 
strongly when commenting upon Shabistari’s wonderful 
poem The Secret Garden: "But the man must not rest in this 
divine union. He must return to this world of unreality, and 
in the downward journey must keep the ordinary laws and 
creeds of man.” 11 

Anwari, like the Western magician-poets of old, empha¬ 
sizes that the poet and lover shade into one another: 

If to be a lover is to be a poet, I am a poet; 

If to be a poet is to be a magician, I am a magician; 

If to be a magician is to be thought evil, I can be 
thought evil; 

If to be thought evil is to be disliked by worldlings, I 
am content to be such. 

Disliked by worldlings is to be a lover of the true real¬ 
ity, more often than not. 

I affirm that I am a Lover! 

A Sufi poet of the seventeenth century says, in the Key of 
the Afghans: 

probably the greatest, but certainly not the only contribution the 
Arabs made in this branch of knowledge.”

The arrow needs an archer, and poetry a magician. 
He must ever hold in his mind the scales of meter, re¬ 
jecting the long and the short. Truth is his mistress, 
astride a black steed, veiled in allegory. From beneath 
her lashes shoot a hundred unerring glances. The poet 
will decorate her fingers with multihued jewels, adorn 
her with the perfume and scent of saffron metaphor. 
Alliteration will ring like footbells; on her bosom will 
be the mystery of concealed rhyme. Together with the 
secrets of inner meaning, the concealing eyes, these 
make her body a perfection of mystery . 12 

What exactly was lost in the transition of the love theme 
from East to West? First of all, the knowledge, which can 
be imparted only by human association, of the wider signif¬ 
icance of love, and where it connects with other elements 
in life. The individual who merely equates love with divinity 
is a barbarian from the point of view of the person who has 
found the connection with the reason of life. Secondly, the 
intricacies, the depth within depth, contained in the works 
of art which were produced by the Sufi Adepts. The bar¬ 
barian takes what nutrition he can from what he sees or 
handles. The color-blind man may see all colors in shades 
of white, gray and black. This may be adequate to his de¬ 
sires, but according to the Sufi, it is not adequate to his 
needs. The intricacy of much Eastern and other art is not 
merely a display of versatility or skill. It is an analogy of the 
infinite successions of meanings which can be transmitted 
by one and the same thing. Further, those who have 
glimpsed the Sufi experiences realize that the multiple 
meanings contained in such a work of art are there, so far 
as the human being is concerned, in order to lead him to a 
true perception of what the inner reality is. It is the percep¬ 
tion of this inner reality which enables him to take himself 
forward to the greater evolution which is the destiny of man.

inside the other, only an excellent artistic or craftsmanlike 
achievement. The Sufi, having found the key to “eternal 
succession” will realize that this produce rs an analogy, not 
something to puzzle or delight the barbarian. So it is with 
the entire love theme for the Sufi. With the analogy of love, 
and the literary use he makes of it, he can help to bridge 
the gap in understanding for others who are at an earlier 
stage of the Path. 

Love is a common denominator for mankind. The Sufi, 
having penetrated its secrets to the tasting of the true reality 
which lies behind, returns to the world in order to convey 
something of the steps of the Path. Those who remain in¬ 
toxicated by the wayside are not his concern. Those who 
wish to go further must study him and his works. 



Miracles and Magic 


The ritual o£ him who has seen the Shah 
(Truth) is above anger and kindness, in¬ 
fidelity and religion. . . . 

( ’Mathnawi, IV) 


A writer named Abdul-Hadi recorded six centuries ago that 
his father told him one day, “You were born as a result of a 
prayer by the great Bahaudin Naqshband of Bokhara, whose 
miracles are innumerable" He conceived as a result of this 
statement such a desire to see this Sufi master that as soon 
as he was able to detach himself from his affairs he traveled 
from Syria to Central Asia. He found Bahaudin (died 
1389), the head of the Naqshbandi Order, sitting sur¬ 
rounded by disciples, and told him that he had had to come 
to him, because he was curious about his miracles. 

Bahaudin said, “There is a food other than ordinary food. 
This is the food of impressions [naqsh-ha], which are pene¬ 
trating into man ceaselessly from many directions of his 
environment. Only the elect know what these impressions 
are, and can direct them. Do you understand?" 

Abdul-Hadi did not see the connection, and remained 
silent. 

“The meaning of this is one of the secrets of the Sufis. 
The master makes the food which is a ‘different’ nutriment 
available to the aspirant, and this aids his development. This 
is outside the laws of happening which can be understood. 


THE SUFIS 


368 

Now, as to what you call miracles. Everyone present here 
has seen miracles. What is important is the function of 
miracles. Miracles may be destined to supply a part of the 
food which is an extra food, and may act upon the mind 
and even the body in a certain way. When this happens, 
the experience of the miracle will perform its due and proper 
function on the mind. If the miracle acts only on the imag¬ 
ination, as with the crude mind, it will stimulate uncritical 
credulity or emotional excitement, or a thirst for more 
miracles, or a desire to understand miracles, or a one-sided 
attachment to, even fear of, the person who is apparently 
responsible for the miracle.” 

This, he continued, made the miracle something which 
could not be explained satisfactorily, because of the many 
different trains of thought which it prompted, different in 
every mind, and the many chains of effect it caused, dif¬ 
ferent in everybody. 

There was nobody, except for the mature Sufi, who could 
recognize the true interpretation of a miracle. This applied 
with an inexplicable miracle. How much more did it apply 
to a miracle which happened, but which was not palpable. 
There were miracles in continuous operation which human¬ 
ity did not perceive through the senses, because they were 
undramatic. An example was a process whereby, against all 
probability, a man might gain or lose moral or material 
things in a frequent succession. Sometimes these are called 
coincidences. All miracles were in fact coincidences—a series 
of things happening in a certain relationship to one another. 

“Miracles,” said Naqshband, “have a function, and that 
function operates whether they are understood or not. They 
have a true [objective] function. Hence, miracles will in 
some people produce confusion, in others scepticism, in 
others fear, in others excitement, and so on. It is the func¬ 
tion of the miracle to provoke reactions and supply nutri¬ 
ment; nutriment in this case which varies with the 
personality acted upon. In all cases the miracle is an instru- 


MIRACLES AND MAGIC 369 

ment of both influence and assessment of the people acted 
upon." 

All miracles, according to the Sufis, have thus such a 
multifarious action on humanity that they cannot be (a) 
performed except when needed, and generally develop as 
incidental happenings; (b) diagnosed or defined because of 
the complexity of their nature. The nature of a miracle 
cannot be detached from its effect, because it would not be 
of any importance if a human being were not involved. 

A typical statement of a miracle attributed to what might 
be called a short-term requirement is contained in a vast 
collection of materials referring to Abdul-Qadir of Jilan, the 
founder of the Qadiri Order of Sufis. 

Sheikh Umru Osman Sairifini and Sheikh Abdul-Haq 
Harini deposed as follows: 

"On the third day of the month of Safar, in the year 555 
of the Flight, we were in the presence of our Master [Sayed 
Abdul-Qadir] in his school. He rose and put on wooden 
sandals, and performed an ablution. Then he performed two 
prayers and gave a loud shout, throwing one sandal into the 
air, when it seemed to disappear. With a further cry the 
Master threw the second sandal into the air and this also 
vanished from our sight. None of those who were present 
dared to question him about the event. 

"Thirty days after this incident a caravan arrived in 
Baghdad from the East Its members said that they had some 
gifts for the Master. We consulted him, and he allowed us to 
accept the presents. The members of the caravan gave us 
some silken and some other cloth and a pair of sandals 
which were the same ones which the Master had hurled from 
him. Their account was as follows: 

“‘On the third day of the month of Safar, that day be¬ 
ing a Sunday, we were on the road with our caravan when 
there was a sudden Arab attack, under two chiefs. The rob¬ 
bers killed some of our number and plundered the caravan. 
They immediately entered a nearby forest for the purpose 
of distributing the loot. We survivors reassembled at the 



THE SUFIS 


370 

edge of the forest It occurred to us that we could invoke the 
aid of the Sayed in our calamity, for we had no recourse and 
no means wherewith to continue our journey. We resolved 
to offer him presents in token of thanksgiving, should we 
at least arrive safely in Baghdad—an improbability as the 
situation then seemed to be. 

“'As soon as we had made this decision, we were alarmed 
by one, and then another, cry which echoed through the 
glades. We concluded that the first band of Arabs had 
been attacked by a second one, and that a fight between 
them would now follow. Soon afterward a party from the 
bandits came to us and said that there had been a disaster. 
They begged us to accept our property back. We proceeded 
to the place at which our merchandise had been collected 
by the Arabs, and found that their two captains were lying 
dead—each with a wooden sandal near his head/ 

“It appears to us indubitable that the Master, having per¬ 
ceived the calamity of the caravaneers, moved by a desire 
to aid them, had been able to project his sandals in such 
a way that the leaders of the band, the ultimately guilty 
parties, were killed. 

“Preserved by us as a matter of record and committed to 
writing in the presence of Almighty God, the Distinguisher 
and Requiter of truth and falsehood." 

The Naqshbandi tradition referring to such events as 
these has it that “when a Friend perceives that a wrong is to 
be righted, he will seek guidance as to the method and per¬ 
mission as to the propriety in a state of contemplation; when 
the necessary effect will follow instantly and continuously 
or subsequently and appropriately." 

“Miracles," says Afghani, “may make you feel conviction 
about a thing. Be sure that whatever they make you feel, 
this is not their actual effect, nor the end of their effect" 

This functional attitude toward miracles underlines, even 
for the outside observer, deeper possibilities of inexplicable 
happenings. If we start from the lowest level of miracles, 
we can see that an action or happening which is familiar 



MIRACLES AND MAGIC yjl 

and explicable to us might be puzzling or conclusive “magi¬ 
cal” evidence to a more ignorant person. Hence, a savage 
seeing fire made by chemical means might consider the 
happening miraculous. At his stage of development, this 
event might produce in him the degree of religious awe 
necessary to make him venerate the performer or obey his 
injunctions. In any case there would be a mental and physi¬ 
cal effect upon him. At the other end of the scale, happen¬ 
ings which cannot be explained by current physical science 
will influence even the most sophisticated modem. In the 
case of the invisible miracles referred to by Naqshband, a 
similar mechanism would be operative. A long succession of 
coincidental and favorable Cor unfavorable) happenings 
involving a human being will be certain to exert over him a 
mental and physical effect, even if the latter is only that he 
will eat more than usual because he can afford to do so 
through his run of luck. 

This theory goes much further than ordinary thinking 
about miracles, and differs from the usual reactions only 
insofar as it insists that nothing is truly accidental or 
isolated. 

This is underlined by the Sufi teaching that “effect is far 
more important than cause, because effect is varied, while 
cause is ultimately only one.” Even the most hardened 
materialist would agree with this, if it were put into his own 
phraseology, something like this: “All action is ultimately 
physical action; and the differences in its effect is deter¬ 
mined by what is being acted upon.” No Sufi would quar¬ 
rel with this, apart from saying that the pure materialist is 
capable of only a limited view of origins and causation, 
seeing them in a one- or two-dimensional way, because of 
the rigidity of his outlook. 

Miracles are connected with causation problems, and 
causation, according to the Sufi, with the problems of space 
and time. Many miracles are considered such because they 
seem to defy the conventions of space or time or both. A 
breakthrough into an extra dimension would rob them of 



THE SUFIS 


372 

their inexplicable quality. But, say the Sufis, since miracles 
have physical effects, it is the effect of the miracle which 
may generally be a part of the food which is not a food, 
which can be significant. It is only on a crude level that an 
investigation into miracles can be attempted. 

A miracle is therefore accepted calmly in Sufi perspective 
as the working of a mechanism which will influence a 
man or woman to the extent to which he is attuned with it 
A crazed savage who wants to immerse himself in the over¬ 
whelming emoting of apparent miraculousness is not a 
candidate for spiritual development; though he may make 
a very much improved and law-abiding member of a con¬ 
ventionally religious society as a result of his experience. 

My own teacher once commented on a question about 
miracles by saying, “Contemplate the phrase Why is the 
sound of an onion?'” to show that some questions cannot 
be put by those who have not the capacity to pose them nor, 
consequently, the potentiality of understanding the real 
answer. 

The evidential miracle as interpreted in conventional 
religion may be of multiple value, according to the Sufis. 
That is to say, it may convey one impression to a man at one 
stage of development; and a form of food to someone more 
advanced. 

We can be even more specific. Professor Seligman was 
surprised to find that incisions made by certain dervishes in 
the flesh stopped bleeding with inexplicable rapidity. Other 
observers have noted that Rifai dervishes could cause 
wounds which seemed to heal without any scar, and with 
absurd rapidity. Until Dr. Hunt in 1931 showed a film of 
Indian Rifais performing these practices, the ordinary re¬ 
action had been to discount the whole thing, or else to at¬ 
tribute it to hypnotism. The Qadiri dervishes are seen walk¬ 
ing upon water; the Azimia are reputed to appear, like many 
of the ancient Sheikhs, at different places at one and the 
same time. Why do these things happen, or seem to happen? 

The dervish has a completely different attitude toward 



MIRACLES AND MAGIC 


373 

them than the ordinary man, whether he be a credulous 
simpleton or a twentieth-century scientist. It must be re¬ 
membered that the Sufi claims that things are not what they 
seem. In demonstrating his ability to do things that others 
cannot do, which appear contrary to accepted physical laws 
familiar to everyone, he states his case. This is as valid a 
method of expressing oneself as any literary form, and more 
effective than most. The fact that this form of statement has 
been abused, misunderstood and counterfeited does not in¬ 
validate the basis of it 

The outside observer, especially if he is what is generally 
considered to be objective or educated, is heavily hampered 
when approaching this problem. His pressing need is to 
explain the phenomena in terms understood by him. He has 
no sense of a duty to extend his own perceptions into the 
phenomena which he is investigating. Yet, from the dervish 
point of view, this man is getting only such nutrition as he 
allows himself to get out of the miracle. When a child is 
afraid of a bogey, he must find an explanation, or have 
a plausible one found for him. When an insensitive man 
looks at inexplicable happenings, and knows that "there 
must be a logical explanation,” this explanation will be 
supplied to him—I do not say how or by whom. 

In Sufism, the secret protects itself. Hallucinations, as 
they are called, work both ways, according to Sufi experi¬ 
ence. A man may think that he sees something which is not 
in fact there. He may also see something other than what is 
really there. How he sees it and what he sees will depend 
upon his own capacity of understanding. I am not now talk¬ 
ing about deliberate deceit and conjuring tricks. To assume, 
just because a thing can be explained in rational terms, that 
this is the only explanation for it is not an absurdity in 
ordinary experience. But it is incorrect if one is living on a 
level where several different explanations are actually seen 
to be possible, in accordance with the quality of the percip¬ 
ient to profit by them. Modem science has not yet acquired 



THE SUFIS 


374 

this special refinement of differentiation—its dimensions are 
not sufficient for the purpose. 

A traditional Sufi method of referring to this situation is 
to use an analogy. Sufis, also traditionally, use analogies 
familiar to the people whom they are addressing. Western 
readers of this book will all know the story of Hans Christian 
Andersen, generally called the tale of the Ugly Duckling. 
The duckling thought that it was ugly; and so it was, seen 
from the point of view of the ducks. All ended well, be¬ 
cause it was discovered that he was a swan. The germ of this 
story is to be found in Jalaluddin Rumi's Mathnawi, where 
a point is stressed which has been lost in the Danish version, 
aimed at a different audience. Rumi tells his hearers that 
they are "ducks, being brought up by hens." They have to 
realize that their destiny is to swim, not to try to be chickens. 

While the subject of magic and miracles is looked at from 
a chicken standpoint by a duckling, his opinions, to say the 
least, are likely to be inaccurate. 

The Scandinavian fabulist gave the story an encouraging 
flavor. The duckling became a swan by the inevitable 
process of growing up. Rumi, always an evolutionist, points 
out that the chick must realize that it is destined to become 
a duck. 

Miracles are now seen as a part of the development pat¬ 
tern of human life. This attitude removes them from the 
preoccupation of the theologian, who seeks to justify them 
on the lower level; and from the sceptic, who seeks to ex¬ 
plain them in terms of scientific theory. They have a 
significant function of their own. In communities where 
the "age of miracles is past," the miracle phenomenon there¬ 
fore continues to operate. One might say that, although the 
volcano is no longer a dragon belching fire, it is still in 
existence as a volcano. 

Retaining our metaphor, we can now descry a sense of 
process in physical phenomena, though the symbolism may 
change. The Turkish secret society in Cyprus, dedicated 
to u nif ying and projecting the dynamic of a community in 



MIRACLES AND MAGIC 375 

its evolution, was known as Volkcm (volcano), thus neatly 
translating the feeling of inner or underground force from 
the physical, transplanted from seemingly independent 
nature-force to the human community. 

This approach to miracles means that, however attractive 
a recital of wonders performed by anyone may be, such a 
rehearsal will not have the same function as the actual event 
which is being reported. This is the explanation of the 
Sufi teaching, “Let the miracle act,” reflected in part by the 
Spanish proverb Haga el miraglo, si hagalo Mahoma—Let 
the miracle be done, even though Mohammed do it 
A degeneration of this sense is the doctrine “The end 
justifies the means.” 

The Sufis, however, do not lose sight of the attendant 
belief that, if the seeming miracle is of importance in the 
development of a group (in this case the Sufis), it is more 
likely to occur in a progressing group, in order to make the 
progress of the group faster or more solid. 'The miracle,” 
says Kamaluddin, “is a foretaste of the power of the group, 
which is developing organs capable of attaining miracles. 
Two things are developing simultaneously—the right atti¬ 
tude toward miracles and the harmonious yoking of the 
Seeker with the miracle factor.” Again looking at the ques¬ 
tion in an evolutionary light, it might be said that the man 
who is lost in crude wonder at the marvels of a motorcar, 
a miracle of a thing, will be slow to step into his proper 
function, which is to use that car, or to be transported by it 
This limiting effect of the sense of wonderment is the rea¬ 
son why Sufi teachers have spoken against indulgence in the 
ecstatic experience, which is only a stage in the development 
of the Sufi. Lost in awe and wonderment, the Sufi Seeker is 
halted when he should be going forward to the realization 
beyond. The seeking of temporary (or even permanent) 
mystical experience is therefore spoken of as a “veil.” 

True reality is held to be beyond ecstasy, as Kalabadhi of 
Bokhara says in his Kitdbel-Taaruf. Junaid (of Baghdad, 
died 910—one of the first classical authors) says that in 



THE SUEIS 


376 

ecstasy man is delighted; but when truth comes, it takes 
ecstasy’s place. He mentions passing through the standard 
Sufi experience of ecstasy followed by unawareness of 
ecstasy. 

A man pestered the teacher Nourettin for information 
about magical powers, healing gifts, and inner satisfaction 
through the Sufi Way. 

Nourettin said, “You are prowling around our campfire, 
brother. Shed wolfish acquisitiveness and sup with us, not 
upon us. You are in the wrong order of thinking. One thing 
must come before another.” 

The visitor said, “Then give me some impressions of you 
and your friends, that I may decide whether to make com¬ 
mon cause with you.” The teacher said, “If you measure us 
against your present ideas, you will be looking through a 
cloudy glass at the sun. This will make you represent us 
in relation to your present ideas and those of your friends 
or enemies. If you collect odd facts about us, your collect¬ 
ing will be determined by a method of selection different 
from the method used in making a posy like ours. Unfortu¬ 
nately for the final aim, the posy may look good, but it will 
not provide the scent which you need.” 

While there is no need to consider honest scholars as 
wolves prowling around the Sufi campfire, the bafflement 
inseparable from trying to study something which is interior 
change through external methods remains, and is often ex¬ 
pressed: ‘Who were the Adepts to whom he [Ghazali] did 
communicate these thrilling secrets? . . . Was there really 
anything to communicate? If so, what?” 1 

“[Lane] mentions the regret which a converted Muslim 
felt at haying to abandon these religious exercises. It is inter¬ 
esting to note that this particular man said that as a dervish 
he had developed unusual telepathic power, so that he knew 
what was going on at a distance and could even hear words 
that were spoken there. Claims to such powers are common-

MIRACLES AND MAGIC 377 

place in Sufi literature. Certainly stories one has heard from 
people of unimpeachable veracity confirm the existence of 
very remarkable powers, whatever the explanation may be/" 2 

Speaking of Najmuddin Kubra (died 1221), precursor of 
Francis of Assisi, the Rev. John Subhan provides a sample 
of the unusual endowments of Sufi Sheikhs: "The in¬ 
fluence of this founder of the Great Brethren (Ikhwan-i- 
Kubrawiyya) was not limited to human beings, but ex¬ 
tended to birds and animals. Phenomena of a very similar 
kind to this are exhibited even today. . . . Standing at the 
door of his khcmaqah, his glance fell on a passing dog. In¬ 
stantly the condition of the dog was changed and it showed 
such behavior as to correspond to that of a man who had 
lost himself (i.e., in the mystic sense). Wherever it went 
dogs gathered round it who would put their paws in his (in 
token of allegiance) and then withdraw themselves and 
stand at a respectful distance surrounding it.” 3 

In the seesaw of magical belief and literature from 
ancient times to the middle ages, and then again until 
today, certain features of magical practice are important 
Sufistically. Magic surrounds Eastern symbolism in a way 
which has not yet been understood outside; and the way in 
which it is understood within Sufi groups is not generally 
available beyond their walls. 

Alchemy is known to be of allegorical as well as literal 
usage. Magical literature veils a good deal of Sufic mate¬ 
rial. Exactly how it is used, and what the allegories are, can¬ 
not be conveyed satisfactorily. But sihr , and sihr d hdd 
(permitted magic), according to Islamic legal definition, 
covers Sufi material part of which is inaccessible elsewhere 
in written form. Fragments are found in Jawahir 4 -Khamsa 
(Five Jewels ) and is religio-magical. Magic is, then, in this 
usage, the vehicle for the transmission of allegorical teach¬ 
ing. Sufism has used the permitted terminology of magic

THE SUFIS 


378 

(as of alchemy, philosophy, science) to convey Sufic mate¬ 
rial. This technique of using the terms of one discipline to 
represent another was brought to the West fairly early. As 
Professor Guillaume notes, the illuminist Sufi Ibn Masarra 
of Cordoba, for instance, “was the first to introduce into the 
West an intentionally ambiguous and obscure use of com¬ 
mon words, and his example has been followed by most 
subsequent esoteric writers .” 4 

Five Jewels itself is derived in part from the magical books 
of El-Buni, the Western magician of the Arabs; and the 
whole high magical tradition of medieval Europe is strongly 
influenced by literal adaptations of the Spanish Arab 
schools whose work includes magical documents. One of the 
reasons for adopting the magical cover was the well- 
established survival value of magical texts, one of whose 
characteristics is that no word shall be altered. It may there¬ 
fore be accepted, as personal investigation has showed, that 
much of the Sufic lore which would not pass muster in a 
theological guise was transmitted in a magical one. 

Magic is a training system as much as it is anything else. 
It may be based upon experience, upon tradition of celestial 
or other ascription, upon religion. Magic not only assumes 
that it is possible to cause certain effects by means of certain 
techniques; it also schools the individual in those techniques. 
Magic, as we know it today, may be subject to every form of 
rationalization. It embodies, taken as a whole corpus of col¬ 
lected material, minor processes such as small hypnotic 
techniques, and beliefs which attempt to duplicate natural 
happenings. While Sufism cannot be taken apart to see 
what its constituents are, the magical tradition, because it 
is a truly composite one, can in fact be so dissected. We are 
only concerned with that part—a very large part-of magic 
which is involved in the effort to produce new perceptions 
and to develop new organs of human development. 

Looked at in this light, a great part of the human 

4 Op. tit., p. 266. 


MIRACLES AND MAGIC 


379 

heritage of magical practice (which often includes religious 
practices) is seen to have been concerned with this quest. 
Magic is not so much based upon assumptions that things 
can be done which transcend the normal man's capabilities, 
as upon the intuitive feeling that, if you like, "faith can 
move mountains." Those magical activities which are de¬ 
signed to exercise the projection of thought or ideas at a 
distance, or to see the future, or to attain a contact with a 
source of superior knowledge, all carry their echo of a dim 
human consciousness that there is a possibility of man's tak¬ 
ing part consciously in the work of evolution; and the 
feeling of a stirring, evolving organ of perception beyond 
those senses which are formally recognized by physical sci¬ 
ence as it stands today. 

Magic, then, to the Sufi, is judged according to Sufic 
criteria. Is it involved in the development of man? If it is, 
where does it stand in relation to the main Sufi stream? 
Magic is seen, Sufistically, as generally a deterioration of a 
Sufic system. The methodology and repute of the system 
continues, but the essential contact with the continuing 
destiny of the system is lost. The magician who seeks to 
develop powers in order to profit by certain extraphysical 
forces is following a fragment of a system. Because of this, 
the warnings against the terrible dangers in magical dab¬ 
bling or obsession are frequent, almost invariable. It is too 
often assumed that the practitioners imposed a ban on casual 
magic because they wanted to preserve a monopoly. From 
the long-term viewpoint it is far more evident that the prac¬ 
titioners themselves have an imperfect knowledge of the 
whole of the phenomenon, some of whose parts they use. 
The "terrible dangers" of electricity are not dangers at all 
to the man who works continuously with electricity, and 
has a good technical knowledge. 

Magic is worked through the heightening of emotion. 
No magical phenomena take place in the cool atmosphere 
of the laboratory. When the emotion is heightened to a cer¬ 
tain extent, a spark (as it were) jumps the gap, and what 



THE SUFIS 


380 

appears to be supernormal happenings are experienced. 
F amili ar as an example to most people are poltergeist 
phenomena. They occur only where there are adolescents 
or others in a state of relatively continuous nervous (emo¬ 
tional) tension. They hurl stones, seem to cancel the force 
of gravity, move tremendously heavy objects. When the 
magician is trying, shall we say, to move a person or an 
object, or influence a mind in a certain direction, he has to 
go through a procedure (more or less complicated, more or 
less lengthy) to arouse and concentrate emotional force. Be¬ 
cause certain emotions are more easily roused than others, 
magic tends to center around personal power, love and 
hatred. It is these sensations, in the undeveloped individual, 
which provide the easiest fuel, emotion, “electricity” for the 
spark to jump the gap which will leap to join a more con¬ 
tinuous current. When the present-day followers of the 
witchcraft tradition in Europe speak of their perambulation 
of a circle, seeking to raise a “cone of power,” they are fol¬ 
lowing this part of the magical tradition. 

But the seer, who places himself into a certain state in 
order to penetrate beyond the time barrier, and the 
magician, who undergoes a course of training in order to 
attain a specific object, differ from the Sufi. The Sufi’s task 
is to so organize himself as to make it possible for the mean¬ 
ingful operation of an organ of perception and action 
which will have a continuing effect The seer and the magi¬ 
cian, like many of the Christian mystics, are not wholly 
regenerated or reconstituted by the process. The Yogi is al¬ 
tered but not made any more meaningful. The Buddhist 
contemplative may have attained what he was striving for; 
but this has no connotation of usefulness or dynamism in 
the sense of activity, particularly for the community. 

Everyone should read Miss Underhill’s book, Mysticism; 
and almost anyone who is interested in mysticism will gen¬

of thinking between the religious and the magical, between 
the mystic and the magus. To the Sufi, this similarity is in

the end contained in the concept of “forward-reaching.” 
This is the origin of the human movement toward, among 
other things, civilization, toward progress, toward more 
knowledge. Miss Underhill considers that the mystic wants 
to “be” and the magically minded wants to “know.” The 
Sufi attitude is undoubtedly that of “being;” but, unlike the 
familiar type of mystic, he will use “knowing” as well. He 
distinguishes between the ordinary knowing of facts and the 
inner knowing of reality. His activity connects and balances 
all these factors—understanding, being, knowing. 

Sufi methodology, too, organizes the emotional force, 
which the magician tries to explode, into a correctly running 
fuel for operating the mechanism of being and knowing. 

Both high magic and ordinary mysticism, viewed in this 
light, become for the Sufi merely the struggling on of a 
partial methodology which will simply reproduce its own 
pattern. Unless it evolves far enough to enable it to repro¬ 
duce more than it inherited, unless, in fact, there is a 
genetic amplification of scope and sufficient power of repro¬ 
duction of that scope, the whole thing is a creaking 
anachronism. At the best it is an escape from the destiny 
of the individual and the community. 

Are magical-type rituals a part of the genuine tradition of 
the Sufis? They are not. For the Sufi, certain symbols will 
have certain associative and certain dynamic functions. 
These he will use, or be influenced by, instinctively. The 
ritual is not used by the developed Sufi for the developed 
Sufis, but it may occur, for the concentrating of the thinking 
involves an exercise of emotional “attachment,” and can 
take place without an equivalent exercise of detachment. 
Pageantry and ritual as used in non-Sufi life (deluding 
processions, regalia, symbolic actions) are viewed by the 
Sufis as undesirable because they increase the attachment 
of the attention to something without developing the balanc- 
ing factor which most people who enjoy traditional pag¬ 
eantry have never even heard of, and obviously often cannot 
quite grasp if they are simply told about it. 



382 THE SUFIS 

Sufi psychology points to an inner mechanism which at¬ 
tempts automatically to balance emotion-causing impacts. 
This is in operation when people react against something 
iW they have been told, or which the community or any 
group is trying to implant in their minds. In the modem 
West it has given rise to a literary method sometimes known 
as “ debunking .” The debunker cannot help doing it, for it 
represents his own need for fulfillment by balance. His 
public accept it gratefully because it feeds a hunger caused 
by emotionality without proper channeling. Intellect does 
not balance emotion at all, because emotion in this sense is 
more clearly portrayed as a ballast which has to be cor¬ 
rectly distributed, or a burden which has to be well placed, 
or a force which is being properly used. It is not something 
which can be suppressed or bypassed by intellect, or which 
can be inhibited in its expression by thinking; or even 
which can be properly redirected by exploding it and start¬ 
ing again. When Western psychologists use, say, catharsis to 
explode emotion or release it, they may apparently fail. If 
they to succeed, they cannot be said to have done more 
t&gt;&gt;an make the patient more socially acceptable. As far as 
anyone can tell, he is less troublesome than he was before. 
This may suit the present phase of society well enough. It is 
not enough for the Sufi, who considers the human being as 
something which is “going somewhere, not something 
which is being kept at, or restored to, some sort of a norm 
fl cgpccprl by purely logical or mainly expedient criteria. 

All this does not mean that the Sufis are not psychologists. 
On the contrary, their psychosomatic treatment is of such 
intense importance to the ordinary world that in many 
places “Sufi” means “physician,” and they are of course con¬ 
sidered magicians in consequence; or mystics. But primarily 
the Sufi is aiming for something, not working with the halt 
and the lame as a vocation. Indeed, his psychological and 
baling (making whole) abilities come from his primary ob¬ 
jective’s operation. His knowledge of the imperfections oi 
supposedly sound humanity is the source of his ability tc

help obviously unsound humanity. Even in "public," ordi¬ 
nary, traditional mysticism, saints did not become saints be¬ 
cause they were healers; they became healers because they 
were saints—even the greatest of them. This leads back to 
the question of developed intuition: ‘When the lion is sick, 
he eats of a certain shrub and cures himself. He does this 
because the illness has an affinity for a certain plant, or for 
the essence of it. The cure is always known to the disease. 
Release this knowledge and you will know more than the 
doctor who can only recall facts and memories which seem 
to apply. There is a difference between hopeful assumptions 
and positive knowledge. And every case of sickness is slightly 
different" [Tibb-cd-Arif (Medicine of the Gnostic), by 
Abdul-Wali, Salik.] 

The Ikhwan El Safa (Faithful Friends, generally called 
in English the Brethren of Sincerity) comprised a secret 
group which became known through their fifty-two treatises, 
published from Basra in about 980 A.D. An objective of this 
school was to make available the whole body of knowledge 
of the time. Their field covered philosophy, religion, science 
and every other branch of learning. They have been ac¬ 
cused of being magicians. like the European Rosicrudans, 
who may have been influenced by them, they are supposed 
to have reserved an inner knowledge. The first step toward 
the realization of this, however, as they saw it, was die estab¬ 
lishing of a medium for the dissemination of more ordinary 
learning. Their individual identity was never established as 
authors, but their connection with the Sufis is undoubted. 
Their name— Safa —is assonant with one interpretation of 
the word "Sufi," and the concept of faithfulness in loving 
friendship is a Sufic one. Their name seems to have been 
adopted from a group of animals in the collection of al¬ 
legorical stories called the Kalilah , who by their steadfast¬ 
ness preserved themselves from a hunter. 

The great master Ghazali shows his debt to them in his 
Ihya (Revival); and among other Sufic teachers, El-Maari, 
the predecessor of Omar Khayyam, is known to have at-

tended their meetings. El Majriti, the astronomer of Madrid, 
or his disciple El Karmani of C6rdoba, and Averroes took 
these teachings to the West, including the musical theories 
which influenced music so profoundly and the moral phi¬ 
losophy which was linked with illumination by the Sufis. 

The great Rumi advises harmony with the Brethren of 
Purity (Sincerity), showing the Sufi character of the myste¬ 
rious encyclopaedists: 

Think well of the Brothers of Purity 

Even though they show harshness toward you; 

For when evil suspicion takes hold of you 
It severs you from a hundred friends. 

If a tender friend treats you roughly to tty you, 

Tis contrary to reason to distrust him. 5 

The reference alludes to the Sufi teaching method in 
which the master may have to test the fortitude of the dis¬ 
ciple, or use what seem harsh measures in order to develop 
bases for Sufic experience. 

At some time before 1066, El Majriti (The Madridian) 
of C6rdoba or his disciple El Karmani brought the Encyclo¬ 
paedia of the Brethren to Spain from the Near East Majri¬ 
ti s scientific work was translated by the Englishman Ade- 
lard of Bath, Britain's first Arabist and the greatest English 
scientist before Roger Bacon. 6 Adelard's importance in 
Western studies is very great indeed, for he provided an early 
channel for the transmission of Sufic ideas during the clas¬ 
sical phase. Studying in both Spain and Syria, he must have 
come into contact with the Sufi centers in both areas which 
were working for the dissemination of book learning plus 
inner teaching. 

Because of his outlook, Adelard has been considered a 
Platonist, though from the Sufi point of view Platonism is 
considered a variety of the current later named Sufism. A

contemporary medievalist 7 shows how Sufic views were pro¬ 
pounded by him, as a part of his great contribution to the 
“center of humane studies and Platonism” of the School 
of Chartres: “Adelard’s view amounts to making the in¬ 
dividual the same as the universal; it is the senses which 
impede our minds with the individual. ... He was the 
first thinker of this period to trace the immediate connec¬ 
tion between divine ideas and actual being. This was largely 
the result of his knowledge of Greek and Arabian science.” 

But the impact of the Brethren was even more startling 
on other forms of mysticism and transcendental thinking in 
the West. 

Since the eleventh century some of the great minds of 
the East and West have been fascinated by the system 
known as the Cabala—the Jewish mystical concept of micro¬ 
cosm and macrocosm, with its theoretical and practical 
branches. By means of the Cabala, man could understand 
himself, wield incalculable power, perform wonders, do and 
be almost anything. Eagerly studied and practiced by Jews 
and Christians alike, the teaching of the Cabala was 
thought to be anchored in the very essence of ancient He¬ 
braic doctrine; the true and ancient teaching which was, in 
fact, the inner, secret doctrine. There is no occult school, 
no magician, no mystic of the West who is not to some ex¬ 
tent influenced by it. The very word is redolent of mystery, 
of power. What are the origins of the Cabala? 

It is a characteristic of Jewish scholarship that honesty and 
detachment are wedded to a search for truth. And hence we 
may not be surprised to find that the Jewish Encyclopae¬ 
dia stresses the determining role of the Brethren of Sincerity 
on the production of the mighty Cabala system: “The Faith¬ 
ful Brothers of Basra originated the eight elements which 
form God,” it says, “changed by a Jewish philosopher in 
the middle of the eleventh century into ten.” 8

8 This alteration of basic Cabalism deprived the Western develop¬ 
ment of the system of a great deal of its meaning and usefulness. 
And Hebrew and Christian Cabala literature later than the twelfth 


THE SUFIS 


386 

The C! aMa came from the region of the Faithful Brothers 
to two places—Italy and Spain. Its system of word manipula¬ 
tion may he derived from parallel and ancient Jewish 
teaching, but it is founded upon Arabic grammar. There is 
a most intriguing link between the Sufistic stream and the 
Jews here, which has caused Sufi teachers to stress the under¬ 
lying identity of the two. These are some of the facts which 
link the Sufis and the Judeo-Christian mystics: 

Ibn Masarrah of Spain was a precursor of Solomon Ibn 
Gabirol (Avicebron or Avencebrol), who propagated his 
ideas. These Sufi tenets “influenced the development of the 
Cabala more than any other philosophical system,” says the 
Jewish Encyclopaedia. And, of course, Ibn Gabirol, the 
Jewish follower of the Arab Sufi, exercised an immense and 
widely recognized influence upon Western thought. God 
is called by the Jewish teacher Azriel in his system of the 
Cabala EN SOF, the absolutely infinite, and it was he who 
undertook to explain the Cabala to philosophers after its ap¬ 
pearance in Europe. There is no doubt that the Arab study 
of grammar and the meanings of words is at the base of the 
usage of words in the Cabala for mystical purposes. Arabic 
grammar was the model for Hebrew grammar. The first 
Hebrew grammar was written by the Jew Saadi (died 94^0 
and was, like all the early ones, in Arabic, and entitled 
Kitab al-Lugha, “in Arabic and under the influence of 
Arabic philology.” (Jewish Encyclopaedia, Vol. 6, p. 69) It 
was not until the mid-twelfth century that Hebrew gram¬ 


mar started to be studied by Jews in Hebrew. 

The Sufis and the Brethren had produced what they con¬ 
sidered to be the most ancient teaching, the secret lore of 
fulfillment and power, and haiided it to the Arabized Jews. 
The Jewish Cabalists adapted this teaching to contempo¬ 
rary Jewish thinking, and the Cabala of the Arabs became 
the Cabala of the Jews, and later of the Christians. But the 
mystical schools of Sufism, which never regarded organized 


centuiy is therefore only of partial meaning. This indudes all a^ects 
of the Gabala of ten elements, as distinct from the Eight Gabala. 



MIRACLES AND MAGIC 387 

book knowledge as a sufficient source, continued to ally 
practice of the Sufic rites with the essentials of the old 
Cabala teaching, and it was in this form that mysticism 
among the Jews was influenced, not primarily through the 
Jewish Cabala. 

This Sufi tradition is underlined by the Jewish Encyclo¬ 
paedia, which says: “To the spread of Sufism in the eighth 
century was probably due the revival of Jewish mysticism 
in Mohammedan countries at that period. Under the direct 
influence of the Sufis arose the Jewish sect called Yud- 
ghanites.” (Vol. xi, p. 579) The effect of the Sufi system 
upon the mystical Jewish Markabah-riders was so profound 
that some of the phenomena (the transition of colors and 
then to colorlessness, for example) produced in the mystic 
are identical with those of the Sufi. Hasidism, the mystical 
piety in practice which arose in Poland in the eighteenth 
century, is not only “the real continuation of the Cabala; 
but it must be based on Sufism or a part of the Cabala, 
which is identical with it.” The same source notes the “strik¬ 
ing analogy” between the practice of the two systems and 
the “many points in common with Sufism” of the Hasidist 
activity, including the relationship of the disciples to the 
master. The very first book of the ethical writings of the 
Judeo-Arabian period is on a Sufi model. Hence “Sufism 
has a special claim upon the attention of Jewish scholars, be¬ 
cause of its influence on the ethical and mystical writings of 
the Judeo-Arabian period.” 

It need hardly be added that the words “Arabian” and 
“Jewish” have little meaning to the Sufis; and this is one 
reason why there was such an entente between the Span¬ 
iards who followed the Sufi way and transmitted so much 
of it to the Christian West. 

The Cabala was, of course, a formulation, a frame for 
the attainment of certain objectives. Like most other sys¬ 
tems—the framework of Sufi Orders is another-of this kind, 
it lingered on as a husk after the time for its dissolution and 
readaptation had passed. 


THE SUFIS 


388 

Magic and miracles, for the Sufi, have a similar, active 
function. They apply for the time and place and other con¬ 
ditions. Since they are both the product of the time and the 
means of a development, they have to he considered as 
limited in one respect and continuing in another. While 
people persist in trying to examine them by other criteria, 
they will continue to convey a bizarre and useless aspect. 



The Teacher, the Teaching, the Taught 


By yourself you can do nothing: seek a Friend. 
If you could taste the slightest bit of your 
insipidity, you would recoil from it. 

(Nizami, Treasury of Mysteries') 


It is often said that the mentality of the Oriental is such that 
he will readily place himself under the instruction of a 
teacher, and will follow directions with an obedience which 
is rare in the West. To anyone who has any real experience 
of the East, this belief is as erroneous as another Western 
generalization—that all Eastern countries are more or less 
the same. The most that can be said about Eastern attitudes 
toward spiritual teachers is that there are more teachers 
available, and also more evidence that they are doing some 
good. 

Almost all human beings are reared with some measure of 
self-reliance, which becomes a habit of thought. Through a 
quite natural lack of true reasoning, the idea of accepting 
guidance becomes confused with a loss of freedom. Most 
people—in East and West alike—do not realize that putting 
oneself in the hands of an expert implies no loss of personal 
importance. Inconsistently, they will allow a surgeon to re¬ 
move their appendixes, but will dispute the superior knowl- 


390 THE SUEIS 

edge or experience of a teacher in a field in which they are 
as ignorant as in surgery. 

Since the Sufis do not preach or try to attract followers, 
material relating to the approach to a teacher is only found 
in the statements of developed Sufis, and generally not from 
those who are themselves teachers. ‘You go to the priest,” 
says one, "from habit or belief, and because he affirms cer¬ 
tain things. You visit the doctor because you have been 
recommended to him, or because you have a sense of 
urgency or desperation. You frequent the company of 
magicians because of an inner weakness; the swordsmith 
because of an outer strength; the shoemaker because you 
have seen his wares and want to possess yourself of some. 
Do not visit the Sufi unless you want to benefit, for he will 
drive you forth if you start to dispute.” 

The Sufi belief is that the attraction of a Sufi teacher is 
essentially because of intuitive recognition; the reasons 
which the would-be Sufi gives are secondary, rationaliza¬ 
tion. One Sufi says, "I knew the master was a great and good 
man before I met him. But only when he brought enlighten¬ 
ment to me did I realize his greatness and goodness to be 
of a far greater order, far beyond my initial capacity to 
understand.” 

The sense of freedom and the reverse tends to be a sub¬ 
jective one in the ordinary man. A Sufi records: “My 
teacher liberated me from the captivity in which I was; the 
captivity in which I thought X was free, when in fact X was 
actually revolving within a pattern.” 

The uncritical carry-over of the sense of self-reliance into 
fields where it does not in fact operate is illustrated in this 
autobiographical fragment from a Sufi: "I resolved that I 
should tread the mystic Path alone, and struggled to do so, 
until an inner voice said to me, *You go to a pathfinder to 
show you a road through a wilderness—or will you prefer 
to seek your own way and destroy yourself in the 
process?'” 1 

1 See annotation “Nonrational Concern.” 



THE TEACHER, THE TEACHING, THE TAUGHT 39I 

While some Sufic faculties may develop spontaneously, 
the Sufi personality cannot mature in solitude, because the 
Seeker does not know exactly which way he is heading, in 
which order his experiences will come. He is at the begin¬ 
ning subject to his own weaknesses, which influence him, 
and from which a teacher “shields” him. For this reason 
Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Saliba said: “Better place a disciple 
under the control of a cat than under his own control.” 
Just as a cat's impulses are varying and uncontrollable, so 
are those of the would-be Sufi at an early stage. 

This parallel of unregenerate man as largely animal, en¬ 
dowed with faculties which he cannot yet properly use, is 
frequent in Sufi teaching: ‘The more animal the man, the 
less he understands of teachership. To him the Guide may 
seem like the hunter, requiring him to enter a cage. I was 
like this,” states Aali-Pir. “The untrained hawk thinks that 
if he is captured, as he calls it, he will be enslaved. He does 
not realize that the hawkmaster will give him a fuller life, 
perched freely on the wrist of the King, without the per¬ 
petual preoccupations of food and fear. The only differ¬ 
ence between human and animal here is that the animal 
fears everyone. The human claims that he is assessing the 
reliability of the teacher. What he is really doing is 
smothering his intuition, his inclination to place hi mse lf in 
the hands of one who knows the Way.” 

There is, again, an interaction between the teacher and 
the taught, which can hardly exist if there is no teacher. 
The Sufi pattern of words, action and cooperation requires 
three things: the teacher, the learner and the community or 
school. Rumi refers to this complex of activity when he 
says: 

Um-amozi tariqish qawli ast 
Harfa-amozi tariqish fall ast 
Faqr-amozi az sohbat qaim ast 

“Science is learned by words; art by practice; detachment 
by companionship.” 



39a the sueis 

And, since the very manner of learning must itself be 
learned, Rumi says in another place: “That which is a stone 
to the ordinary man is a pearl to him who knows.” 

The function of the teacher is to open the mind of the 
Seeker, so that he may become accessible to a recognition 
of his destiny. In order to do this, man must realize how 
much of his ordinary thinking is cramped by assumptions. 
Until this point is reached, true understanding is impossi¬ 
ble, and the candidate is only fit for one or another of the 
more usual human organizations which train him to think 
along cer tain lines: “Open the door of your mind to the 
waif of understanding; for you are poor and it is rich.” 
(Rumi) 

Sufism may be viewed in one sense as struggling against 
the use of words to establish patterns of thinking whereby 
mankind is kept at a certain stage of ineptitude; or made 
to serve organisms which are ultimately not of evolutionary 
value. 

A Sufi was once asked why the Sufis use words in a spe¬ 
cial sense, possibly removed from their accustomed signifi¬ 
cance. His answer was: “Rather ponder upon why the 
ordinary man suffers from the tyranny of words, immobi¬ 
lized by custom until they only serve as tools.” 

The relationship between the teacher and the person 
taught cannot be understood in Sufism apart from the teach¬ 
ing. A part of the teaching stands outside time and space. 
This corresponds to the element in the teacher and the 
learner which has a similar status. A part of the teaching is 
within all of the many aspects into which the ordinary 
human consciousness splits up experience, life and the 
world of forms. An interaction of a special kind is producing 
a transformation. This relationship, therefore, far tran¬ 
scends in ultimate meaning the usual scope of teaching 
and learning. The Sufi teacher is more than one who is 
passing on formal knowledge; more than one who is in a 
state of harmony with the learner; more than a machine 
which imparts a portion of a stock of information that is 



THE TEACHER, THE TEACHING, THE TAUGHT 393 

available in stored form. And he is teaching more than a 
method of thinking, or an attitude to life; more even than 
a potentiality to self-development. 

The Czech Professor Erich Heller, in his preface to a 
book which rapidly became a classic of teaching in the mid¬ 
twentieth century, touches on the problem of studying 
literature, and especially of teaching it He says that the 
teacher “is involved in a task which would appear impossible 
by the standards of the scientific laboratory—to teach what, 
strictly speaking, cannot be taught, but only caught/ like 
a passion, a vice, or a virtue.” (The Disinherited Mind, 
London, 1952) 

The function of the Sufi teacher is even more complex 
than this. Unlike the teacher of literature, however, he has 
no task in the usual sense of the word. His task is in being, 
being himself; and it is through the proper functioning of 
that being that his meaning is projected. Thus it is that 
there is no division in the public and private personality of 
the Sufi teacher. He who has one face in the classroom and 
another at home, who has a professional attitude or a bed¬ 
side manner, is not a Sufi. This consistency, however, is 
within himself. His external behavior may very well appear 
to change, but his inner personality is unified. 

The actor, who gets “into the skin of the part,” cannot be 
a Sufi teacher. The man or woman whose official face runs 
away with him, so that he is carried away by a temporary 
personality, cannot be a Sufi teacher. One does not have 
to be as advanced a case as Walter Mitty, the creation of 
James Thurber, to experience "involvement,” a state which 
is possible only to those at a low level of Sufi awareness. 
Teachership cannot come through anyone prone to tempo¬ 
rary possession by a character. 

Yet, so firmly established in the ordinary man is the habit 
of alternating personality that it is socially accepted to “act 
a part.” In a very large proportion of instances of this 
standard social procedure, there is a carry-over of the syn¬ 
thetic or alternate personality. This is not in itself con- 



THE SUEIS 


394 

sidered to be an evil; it is undoubtedly an indication of 
immaturity in the Sufic sense. 

This inner unification of personality, expressed through 
a diversity of ways, means that the Sufi teacher does not 
resemble the outer, idealized personality of the literalist. 
The calm, never-changing personality, the aloof master, or 
the personality which inspires awe alone, the “man who 
never varies” cannot be a Sufi master. The ascetic who has 
attained detachment from things of the world and is thus 
himself an externalized incarnation of what seems to the ex¬ 
ternalist to be detached is not a Sufi master. The reason is 
not far to seek. That which is static becomes useless in the 
organic sense. A person who is always, as far as can be 
ascertained, calm and collected, has been trained to have 
this function, the function of detachment. He “never shows 
agitation” and, by depriving himself of one of the functions 
of organic as well as mental life, he has reduced his range of 
activity. The overtrained becomes muscle-bound. 

Detachment, for the Sufi, is a part, only a portion, of 
dynamic interchange. Sufism works by alternation. Detach¬ 
ment of intellect is useful only if it enables the practitioner 
to do something as a result. It cannot be an end in itself in 
any system which is dealing with humanity's self-realization. 

In partial or derelict metaphysical systems, of course, the 
means has become an end. The attaining of detachment, 
or immobility, or benignity (which are all parts of any in¬ 
dividual's development) are considered to be so strange, or 
desirable in themselves , and so rarely attainable, that the 
practitioner “settles for” them. 

A further development comes when rationalizations are 
provided, intended to prove that the attainment of detach¬ 
ment, or asceticism, or any of the other partial develop¬ 
ments, has some sort of sublime or infinite meaning. “So- 
and-so attained complete detachment, and as a result he 
was supremely enlightened,” and much more of this be¬ 
comes the legend. Of course the one does not follow from 
the other, but somehow it seems to follow. In Western 



the teacher, the teaching, the taught 395 

Europe you will hear, from otherwise quite sensible people, 
such non sequiturs as “So-and-so is wonderful; he can con¬ 
trol his heartbeat. I always go to him for advice about my 
personal problems.” If die same person were told: “So- 
and-so is wonderful; he can type ninety words a minute- 
take your problems to him,” the reaction would be instant 
indignation. 

A person can only teach, in the metaphysical area and 
giving him the benefit of any doubt about sincerity, what 
he actually believes to be true. If he teaches you that 
through standing on your head you will reach some sort of 
mystical goal, he must first arouse in you some degree of 
belief that it has already been attained by this method. This 
is what might be called positive affirmation, and may be ac¬ 
cepted or rejected. The Sufi teaching method embraces a 
wider field. By drawing attention to other points of view 
than conventional ones, and by practicing a complex of 
activities collectively termed Sufism, the teacher endeavors 
to make available to the learner the materials which will 
develop his consciousness. His procedure, as Sir Richard 
Burton remarks, may even appear to be destructive, but is 
“essentially reconstructive.” Rumi refers to this factor when 
he talks about pulling down a house in order to find a 
treasure. A man does not want his house pulled down, even 
though the treasure is of greater use to him than the build¬ 
ing for which (for the purposes of this illustration we may 
assume this) he has no special affection. The treasure, as 
Rumi says, “is the reward of the pulling down of the house.” 
It is not a matter of being compelled to break eggs before an 
omelet can be made; but of the eggs doing their own break¬ 
ing in order to be able to aspire to omelethood. 

The “guide, philosopher and friend” who is the Sufi 
teacher, then, performs what may be considered to be 
many functions. As a guide he shows the Way—but the 
aspirant must himself do the walking. As a philosopher he 
loves wisdom, in the original meaning of the term. But 
love, to him, implies action, not merely enjoyment or even 



396 the SUFIS 

the despair of one-sided love. As a friend he is a companion 
and adviser, provides reassurance and a point of view which 
is influenced by his perception of the other's needs. 

The Sufi teacher is the link between the disciple and the 
goal. He embodies and symbolizes both the “work” itself, of 
which he is a product, and also the continuity of the system, 
the “chain of transmission.” Just as the army officer sym¬ 
bolizes, for practical purposes, the State and its objectives 
for the private soldier, so the Sufi symbolizes the tutikci, the 
wholeness of the Sufi entity. 

The Sufi teacher cannot be an earthshaking personality 
who attracts millions of adherents and whose fame rever¬ 
berates into every comer of the earth. His stage of illumina¬ 
tion is visible for the most part only to the enlightened. Like 
a radio receiving apparatus, the human being can perceive 
only those physical and metaphysical qualities which are 
within his range. Therefore the man (or woman) who is 
bemused and impressed by the personality of a teacher will 
be the person whose awareness is insufficient to handle the 
impact and make use of it. The fuse may not blow, but the 
element becomes destructively or inefficiently incandescent. 
“A blade of grass cannot pierce a mountain. If the sun that 
illumines the world were to draw nigher, the world would 
be consumed.” (Rumi, Mathnawt, Bk. I, Whinfield s ver¬ 
sion) The evolving man can only glimpse the qualities of 
the stage next above him. Obviously, even on the physical 
analogy, the generality of people cannot even perceive the 
real qualities of the sage, the man of the fourth stage of 
Sufic development, when he is at the first or second stage. 

The comparison which is used by Sufis is this—a little 
light is useful to the bat. The brilliance of the sun is useless 
to him, even though he may become intoxicated by it. 

The so-called free or rational mind, when approaching 
problems of teachership, makes the most amazing assump¬ 
tions. A person who says, “I will follow someone who satis¬ 
fies me that he is genuine,” is only saying, together with the 
savage, “If a person appears to me to have strange powers 



the teacher, the teaching, the taught 397 

or otherwise defeats my mechanism of assessment, I shall be 
prepared to obey him.” Such a person is useful to the jungle 
witch doctor who has just imported 'miraculous” magne¬ 
sium flares from Germany; but he is of little use to him¬ 
self. Still less use is he to the Sufi cause; because he is not 
ready for truth, however ready he may be for bewilderment. 
He must have intuitive capacity for recognizing truth. 

A man came to Libnani, a Sufi teacher, while I was sit¬ 
ting with him, and this interchange took place: 

Man: "I wish to learn, will you teach me?” 

Libnani: "I do not feel that you know how to learn.” 

Man: "Can you teach me how to learn?” 

Libnani: "Can you learn how to let me teach?” 

The variety of teachers is enormous in Sufism, partly 
because they consider themselves to be a part of an organic 
process. This means that their impact upon humanity may 
be taking place without any consciousness on the part of 
humanity of the relationship. As one example, the Sufi of 
the middle ages might move from place to place dressed in 
a patchwork garment, and teach by signs, perhaps not speak¬ 
ing, perhaps saying cryptic words. He established no formal 
school himself, but made sure that the message of Sufihood 
was communicated to people in the countries through which 
he passed. This strange figure is known to have operated 
in Spain and elsewhere in Europe. The name given the 
silent teacher who performed strange movements, inciden¬ 
tally, was aghlaq (plural aghlaqin , pronounced with gut- 
teral r and European "q” as arldkeen , arlequm). This is an 
Arabic play upon the words for "great door” and "confused 
speech. There can be little doubt that his appearance to 
the uninitiated is perpetuated in the Harlequin. 

A Sufi Adept may dress in a patchwork coat or in ordi¬ 
nary clothes. He may be young or old. Hujwiri mentions 
an encounter with a youthful teacher of this kind. A man 
who wanted to learn about Sufism saw the youth dressed 
as an Adept, but with an ink bottle at his side. He thought 
that this was unusual, for Sufis are not scribes. He ap- 


398 THE SUFIS 

proached the “imposter” whom he took to he a scribe profit¬ 
ing by the repute of the patchwork robe, and asked him 
what Sufism was. “Sufism,” was the answer, “is not to think 
that because a man carries a pot of ink he is not a Sufi.” 

While a Sufi may attain illumination within a long or a 
short time, he cannot actually teach until he has received 
the Robe of Permission (to enroll students) from his own 
mentor; and by no means are all Sufis material for teacher- 
ship. The esoteric interpretation of a certain joke sums this 
up: 

Nim-hakim khatrai jan 

Nim-mulla khatrcti iman . 

The half-physician is a danger to life; 

The half-priest is a threat to faith. 

The half-Sufi, in this sense, may be a man who is lib¬ 
erated from the need for being himself a disciple, but who 
has to continue along the Way himself to the final attain¬ 
ment. Being preoccupied with his own development, he 
cannot teach. 

The teacher is referred to as the Sage (flfif), guide (mur- 
shid), Elder (pir) or Sheikh (leader, chief). A great many 
other words are used, in different shades of meaning de¬ 
noting the precise nature of the relationship between mem¬ 
bers of a group and their teacher. 

There are three routes which can be indicated by the 
teacher for the postulant. In most Sufi systems, the beginner 
goes through a novitiate of a thousand and one days, in 
which his ability to receive instruction is assessed and 
increased. If he does not fulfill this period (which may be 
figurative, and consist of another period of days), he will 
have to leave the precincts of the school Qmadrasd ). The 
second route is when the teacher accepts an applicant di¬ 
rectly, without having him attend the general assemblies of 
the group or circle (hctlka or daira), and gives him special 
exercises to perform in concert with himself and independ- 



the teacher, the teaching, the taught 399 

ently. The third route is when, after assessing the capacities 
of the student, the teacher accepts him formally but sends 
him to another teacher who specializes in the exercises 
which will more directly benefit him. Only the teachers 
of certain schools apply all the exercises which might be 
indicated generally the schools of Central Asia, and espe¬ 
cially the Naqshbandi element called the Azimiyya, who 
incorporate numerous teaching methods in a form of over¬ 
lap procedure. 

Such teachers have a combined method which is cen¬ 
tered within their inner circle, technically termed the 
rnarliaz, centrifuge, center of a circle, headquarters.” A 
session of Sufis performing such exercises is referred to as 
a marlzaz; though when not actually engaged in exercises 
they might be termed a majlis (a session). 

All Sufi teachings being disposed toward multiple mean- 
ing, depending upon how much or on what level the in¬ 
dividual can grasp them, there are many illusions in 
literature to the role of the teacher which are sometimes 
translated literally. Rumi, as an instance, says: 'The worker 
is concealed in the workshop.” This is generally taken to 
refer to the immanence of God. In the theological sense 
this is completely true, and like all Sufi teachings it is con¬ 
sidered to convey objective truth. This means that it is true 
in every possible interpretation. Insofar as it is applied to 
teachership, however, it means that the Sufi Guide is a part 
of the work as well as the teacher of the Sufis—the whole 
process, teacher, teaching and taught, is a single phenom¬ 
enon. 

The implicit consequence that teachership cannot be 
studied in isolation where the Sufis are concerned is con¬ 
sidered a central fact of high initiatory importance. The 
would-be student of the Sufis may not be able or inclined 
to grasp it; but unless the Sufi grasps it, he cannot be a Sufi 
at all. 

For this reason the function and character of the Sufi 


400 THE SUFIS 

teacher is always allowed to grow in the perception, by 
means of such material as has been assembled above, to¬ 
gether with the actual practice of Sufism. 

Professor A. J. Arberry of Cambridge, who has ap¬ 
proached Sufism from a consistently sympathetic, academic 
viewpoint, shows the difficulties which have to be faced by 
the externalist or intellectual worker, the “obscurity of a 
doctrine based largely on experiences in their very nature 
well nigh incommunicable .” 2 

1 was present one day when a Sufi Sheikh in die Near 
East was being closely questioned by a foreign student of 
the occult who was desperate to know how he could rec¬ 
ognize a Sufi teacher, and whether the Sufis had any 
Messianic legends foreshadowing the possibility of a Guide 
who would bring people back to metaphysical awareness. 
“You yourself are destined to be a leader of this sort,” said 
the Sheikh, “and Eastern mystics will be prominent in your 
life. Keep faith.” Later he turned to his disciples and said, 
“That was what he came here for. Do you refuse a child a 
sweetmeat, or tell a lunatic that he is insane? It is not our 
function to rehabilitate the ineducable. When a man says, 
‘How do you like my new coat?’ you must not say, It is 
horrible,’ unless you can manage to give him a better one, 
or teach him better taste in dress. Some people cannot be 

taught nf 

“Rumi said: Tou cannot teach by disagreement.

The influence of Sufism upon Indian mystical life has been 
so great that several schools which had been considered to 
be the product of ancient Hinduism are revealed by scholars 
to have originated in Sufi teachings. This historical fact is 
of less importance to the Sufi than the fact that the mystical 
stream, its source, is essentially one. The different outward 
aspects of mysticism in the Far East have generally caused 
it to be assumed that the cults are independent products of 
the culture in which they are rooted* But such a view of life 
is impossible to those who believe that there is only one 
truth, and that those who know it must communicate and 
cannot remain in compartments. 

Over a thousand years ago the seed which was to bloom 
into a variety of meditative schools of apparently Hindu 
origin was planted in India. The love mysticism of the 
bhakti type is one example, here noted by Dr. Tara Chand, 
in the Cultural History of India: 

Certain other characteristics of South Indian thought 



402 THE SUFIS 

from the ninth century onward, however, strongly 
point to Islamic influence. They are the increasing 
emphasis on monotheism, emotional worship, self¬ 
surrender Qjctrpattt) and adoration of the teacher 
(guru bhakti ), and, in addition to them, laxity in the 
rigors of the caste system and indifference to mere 
ritual . . . absorption in God, through devotion to a 
teacher. . . . The Sufi conception of the deified teacher 
was incorporated into medieval Hinduism. 

Dr. Chand, great scholar though he is, fails to note here 
that the significant points which he lists are, in their group¬ 
ing and emphasis, Sufic rather than directly Islamic in the 
usual sense—in the sense in which they are understood 
by the Moslem clergy. In most Indian cults the Tole of the 
deified teacher has been perverted from its originally Sufi 
nature, and has undergone a transformation which has 
given later Hindu schools a non-Sufi emphasis. All too often 
these are the cults which fascinate Western students, anx¬ 
ious to find spirituality in action in the East, who tend to 
be reduced to attachment to mere derivatives of Sufi schools, 
which use the trappings of Hinduism. 

Although they undoubtedly had something to build upon, 
it was the Sufi teachers who were responsible in great meas¬ 
ure for the establishing of what became known as great 
Hindu schools of mysticism. Auguste Barth notes in his 
Religions of India the correspondence between the geo¬ 
graphical and chronological settlement of Sufis in India and 
the rise of what were later to be thought Indian mystical 
schools of great antiquity: 

It is precisely in these parts that, from the ninth to 
the twelfth century, those great religious movements 
took their rise which are connected with the names of 
Sankara, 1 Ramanuja, Ananda Tirtha and Basava, out 

1 Vedanta is a revival, based upon the ancient Hindu scriptures 
interpreted over a thousand years after their composition by Sankara 
(788-820). This system (Vedanta means “completion of the Vedas ) 



THE FAR EAST 


403 

of which the majority of the historical sects came and 
to which Hinduism presents nothing analogous until 
a much later period. 

One factor has prevented students from being able to 
check the claims to great antiquity made for the mystical 
movements among the Hindus. This was, strange though it 
may seem to most readers, the fact that the early Hindu 
religious literature was written down only in the late eight¬ 
eenth and early nineteenth centuries, at the instance of 
such British scholars as Sir William Jones . 2 “Ancient docu¬ 
ments scarcely exist The oldest Indian manuscript is 
thought to be a Buddhist fragment on birch bark of the late 
fifth century A.D., from Taxila. The Bakhshali manuscript, 
of the same material, seems the next claimant for high an¬ 
tiquity, though this is only of the twelfth century .” 3 The 
Bhakti and reformist movements in Hinduism, which pro¬ 
duced such great names as Madhva, Ramananda and Kabir, 
are based to a great extent upon Sufi thought and practice, 
introduced into India after the Islamic conquest. Kabir 
“spent considerable time with Moslem Sufis;” Dadu “mani¬ 
fests perhaps even greater knowledge of Sufism than his 
predecessors . . . perhaps because the Sufis of Western 
India wielded greater influence upon the minds of the 
seekers after God, Hindu or Moslem, than those of the 
East,” says Tara Chand, who is not himself a Sufi. 

The Sikh religion, it is a matter of historical fact, was 
founded by the Sufized Hindu Guru Nanak, who freely 
admitted his debt to Sufism. Of him the Cultural History 
says: 

covers the ground introduced by Ghazali, Ibn El-Arabi and Rumi, 
following the Sufi ancients. The resemblance of Kant’s work to 
Vedanta is attributable to the Sufi philosophical stream. See: The 
Absolution of Sankacarya as Compared with Mawlana Jalal Uddin 
Rumts School of Thought by the Turkish scholar Rasih Guven, in 
Prajna, Pt. I, 1958, pp. 93-100.

Manifesdy he was steeped in Sufi lore, and the fact of 
the matter is that it is far harder to find how exactly 
he drew from the Hindu scriptures. His rare refer¬ 
ences to them lead one to imagine that Nanak was only 
superficially acquainted with the Vedic and Puranic 
literature. 

The name “Sikh” means Seeker, the style used for the 
Sufi traveler. 

Maharshi Devendranath Tagore (1815-1905)—the fa¬ 
ther of Rabindranath Tagore-spent two years in the Hima¬ 
layas. During this time he was not studying the scriptures 
of his Hindu patrimony, but a poem from the Sufi master 
Hafiz, as a consequence of which he was rewarded with a 
beatific vision, according to another Hindu savant. Profes¬ 
sor Hanumantha Rao. 

The later Sufi teachers in India, many of whom followed 
the Turkish, Afghan and Persian conquerors, had an effect 
upon the country which is second to none. One of the con¬ 
sequences of their arrival was that the Hindus actually 
adopted the Arabic word for a dedicated Sufi—Fakir—and 
applied it to themselves. 

Whole books have been filled with the amazing deeds 
and miracles attributed to these men, and even today mil¬ 
lions of people of every persuasion gather to worship or 
invoke their aid as saints. 

Muinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishti Order in 
India, was sent to Ajmer in the middle of the twelfth cen¬ 
tury, to bring his teaching to the Hindus. The Raja Prithvi 
Raj, who resented his arrival, is reputed to have assembled 
soldiers and magicians to stop him entering the city. The 
soldiers were struck blind when the saint, following a 
precedent of the Prophet, threw a handful of pebbles to¬ 
ward them. One glance from the eyes of Muinuddin, we 
are told, and three hundred Yogis and Pandits were unable 
to open their mouths, and became his disciples. But by far 
the most impressive tale is that of the supernatural combat 



THE FAR EAST 


405 

between the famous Hindu magician Jaypal Yogi and the 
Sufi Fakir. 

Jaypal brought with him some thousands of his Yogi dis¬ 
ciples, according to the Chishti legend, and cut off the 
water supply to Lake Anasagar. One of the Chishti's new 
converts, under Muinuddin’s orders, took one bucketful of 
water out of the lake—whereupon every stream and well 
in the area became dry. 

Jaypal sent hundreds of apparitions, including lions and 
tigers, to attack the saint and his following. They were all 
destroyed as soon as they touched the magic circle which 
Muinuddin had drawn for protection. After a number of 
similar feats, Jaypal surrendered and became one of the 
Chishti s most famous disciples, known as Abdullah of the 
Wilderness, because he is supposed to wander eternally in 
the vicinity of the great shrine at Ajmer. 

There are, quite perceptibly, three levels of contact be¬ 
tween the Sufis and the Hindu or Sikh mystics. A misun¬ 
derstanding of this has been responsible for much confu¬ 
sion. In the historical and cultural context, as well as in the 
truly metaphysical one, all parties share a sense of unity of 
aims in the role of mysticism to develop man. They are also 
at one in their essential harmony. It is in the field of rigid 
and repetitious ritual, fossil dogma and personality venera¬ 
tion that there are very considerable rifts. 

The narrow, morbidly formalist Moslem who is following 
a superficial Sufic way will clash almost invariably with his 
opposite number, the professional Hindu ascetic wedded to 
a deteriorated tradition. 

Since it is these last who make the most noise and show, it 
is they who are taken, all too often, by outsiders as genuine 
representatives of the mystical stream of India. Their 
studied asceticism and worldly endowments are almost al¬ 
ways far more striking and attention compelling than the 
schools of the real mystics. They also tend to burst into 
print, to provide material for documentary photographers, 
to recruit disciples from abroad, to try to spread their teach- 



406 the sufis 

ing as widely as possible. Many of the Eastern-based cults of 
the Western world are in fact nothing more than deriva¬ 
tions of these menageries, which have assumed the tradi¬ 
tions and superficial color of the authentic tradition. 

They tend not to accord with the advice of the great 
teacher, Sheikh Abdullah Ansari, felicitously translated by 
a distinguished Sikh, the Sardar Sir Jogendra Singh: 

'Tasting is only the saving of bread. Formal prayer is for 
old men and women. Pilgrimage is a worldly pleasure. Con¬ 
quer the heart—its mastery is conquest indeed. The Sufi 
Law of Life requires: 

Kindness to the young 
Generosity to the poor 
Good counsel to friends 
Forbearance with enemies 
Indifference to fools 
Respect to the learned." 

There is an interesting interaction between Hindu 
thought and Sufi teaching, an example of which is con¬ 
tained in the commentary on the Slokas . A great deal of 
Hindu popular wisdom is contained in a series of sayings 
called Slokas, passed on from a teacher to his disciple. Sufi 
commentary, such as that of Ajami, holds that the Slokas 
as generally circulated are one half of a double system of 
instruction. Like the fables of Aesop or the tales of Saadi, 
they may be read either as merely good advice upon which 
one could rear one’s children, or for their inner meaning. 

Here are some of the Slokas (s), together with Ajami’s 
comment CO which is used as an exercise by Indian Sufis. 
These Slokas have been numbered in accordance with Abbe 
Dubois’ great work, Hindu Manners, Customs and Cere¬ 
monies (Oxford, 1906, pp. 474 et seq.): 

(s) V. In the affli ctions, misfortunes and tribulations of 
life, only he who actively helps us is our friend. 

(c) Study whether you know what help is. Enlighten¬ 
ment is necessary before the wild one knows it

of a fly in its head, that of a serpent in its fangs. But the 
venom of a wicked man is to be found in all parts of his

well distributed. 

C s ) XVIII. The virtuous man may be compared to a 
large leafy tree which, while it is itself exposed to the heat

(c) The virtue of a good man will assist the sincere, 
but will weaken the indolent. Shelter is only a respite from

(0 XLI. A shameless man fears the maladies engen¬ 
dered by luxury, a man of honor fears contempt, a rich per¬ 
son fears the rapacity of kings, gentleness fears violence, 
beauty fears old age, the penitent fears the influence of 
the senses, the body fears Yama, the god of death; but the 
miser and the envious fear nothing. 

(c) Be a wise man, for he understands the nature of 
fear. It is therefore his slave. 

There had been a thousand years* interchange between 
the Sufis and Hindu mystics before any Western scholar 
interested himself in Indian mysticism. In the seventeenth 
century Prince Dara Shikoh of the Mogul line carried out a 
thorough assessment of Vedic literature and a comparison 
between Islamic and Hindu modes of thought. Like the 
Sufi teachers before him, he came to the conclusion that 
Hindu scriptures were the remnant of an esoteric tradition 
identical with that of Islam, and in its most inner sense 
precisely the same as the Sufi one. 

His researches included also the sacred books of the Jews 
and Christians, studied from the point of view that they 
might represent the exteriorization of an inevitable develop¬ 
ment of human consciousness concentrated from time to 
time in certain population groups. It is upon the basis of 



THE SOTIS 


408 

his work, which itself follows the attitude of the scholars of 
Haroun el-Rashid of Baghdad, that a great deal of subse¬ 
quent, even quite modem, mystical comparison rests. 

The work of Dara Shikoh, striking because carried on by 
a Moslem prince of a family ruling a land of unbelievers, is 
only one expression of the contact carried on by Sufis 
throughout India for centuries. In this respect the process 
can be seen as closely approaching that which took place in 
medieval Europe, when the existence of a strong and 
authoritarian Church did not prevent the development of 
groups such as those Sufi-organized ones which we have 
unearthed in previous chapters. 

The role of Sufism, however, should not be considered 
to be one of projecting the results of comparative religious 
study and stressing the theosophical theory of the essential 
unity of religious manifestations. There has never been a 
time when the Sufis did not regard themselves as being in¬ 
volved in a task—the task of transcending outward forms 
and making common cause with the religious fact, the ac¬ 
quisition of knowledge about religion by means of itself. 
While it might be difficult to explain in the cruder terms of 
accepted formal religion that there was a unity in experi¬ 
ence, that unity was nevertheless there all the time. The 
nearest that one can get in familiar terminology to this fact 
is to say that for the Sufi and other mystics of the Sufic 
stream, this was a psychological study, not an academic one. 
The object of the study, again using the limited phraseology 
available to us here, was to make oneself available to the 
inner motivation which was trying to produce a further 
development in human consciousness. Mysticism and reli¬ 
gion, therefore, are looked upon as the yoking of the indi¬ 
vidual and the group with the destiny of mankind as ex¬ 
pressed in a mental urge. 

A resemblance between Sufi thought and practice and 
the strange, allegedly typical Buddhistic cult of Zen as 
practiced in Japan is of great interest. Zen claims to be a

4°9 

secret transmission outside of the canonical Buddhist field, 
passed on by individual example and teaching. Historically 
it is of no great age, and it is not connected even by its 
practitioners with any special event in the life of Buddha. 

Its earliest records date from the eleventh century, while 
the earliest school to be founded in Japan was brought from 
China in 1191. 

The period during which Zen was imported into Japan 
corresponds with the modem growth of Indian schools 
under Sufi impetus. Its place of origin—South China—is 
the location where there were settlements of Arabs and 
other Moslems for centuries. Buddhism itself in Japan only 
dates from the year 625, and mainly came into the islands 
between the second half of the seventh century and the 
beginning of the ninth century. Moslem and Sufi penetra¬ 
tion and conquest of the traditional Buddhist shrines of 
Central Asia was well under way by then; it was from the 
great Buddhist strongholds of Afghanistan that the Bud¬ 
dha cult entered Tibet, after the Moslem conquest. 

There are legends connecting Chinese Zen with India, 
and Sufi tradition asserts that the early classical Sufis made 
spiritual contact with the followers of bodd, just as they had 
found a common denominator with the mystics of the 
Hindus. 

The similarities between Zen and Sufism, both in termi¬ 
nology* stories and activities of masters, are considerable. 
From the Sufi viewpoint, the practice of Zen as given in 
popular literature resembles irresistibly the working of a 
part of the techinque of the “impact” (zctrb') of Sufism. 

Dr. Suzuki, the foremost literary Zen exponent, would 
seem to be right in considering Zen adapted to the Far East¬ 
ern mind, but ideas, allegories and examples contained in 
Sufi teaching were well established centuries before the 
Zen teacher Yengo (c. 1566-1642) wrote the letter quoted 
in answer to “What is Zen?” Those who have read the fore- 
going chapters of this book will be well familiar with such 



THE SUEIS 


410 

phraseology as this, if allowance is made for a Far Eastern 
staccato turn of speech: 

It is presented right to your face, and at this moment 
the whole thing is handed over to you. For an intel¬ 
ligent fellow, one word should suffice to convince him 
of the truth of it, but even then error has crept in. 
Much more so when it is committed to paper and ink, 
or given up to wordy demonstration or to logical quib¬ 
ble, then it slips further away from you. The great 
truth of Zen is possessed by everybody. Look into your 
own being and seek it not through others. Your own 
mind is above all forms; it is free and quiet and suffi¬ 
cient paternally stamps itself on your six senses and 
four elements. In it light is absorbed. Hush the dualism 
of subject and object. Forget both, transcend the in¬ 
tellect, sever yourself from understanding, and directly 
penetrate deep into the identity of the Buddha-mind; 
outside of this there are no realities. 4 

It would be easy to attempt to build upon these striking 
facts a case for the transmission of Sufism and the ultimate 
derivation of what is now called Zen from that source. But, 
according to Sufi belief, the basis must always have been 
there, working in the human mind. Any Sufic contact would 
merely have helped to rekindle the inner consciousness of 
the only true reality. 

A Chinese Sufi, Mr. H. L. Ma, speaking at a meeting of 
the Hong Kong Metaphysical Association a decade ago, 
shows how the way of putting ideas can seem to vary with 
the cultural environment: 

With respect to all the Seekers of Truth, I must say 
that Su-fi is hard to impart. Why? Because new hearers 
expect the unfolding of a system to follow their ac¬ 
cepted pattern of thought. They do not know that this 
pattern is what is wrong with them. Su-fi is in you al-

ready. You feel it but you do not know what it is. When 
you feel certain feelings of kindness, love, truth, want¬ 
ing to do something with all of you—that is Su-fi. You 
think of yourself first—that is not Su-fi. You have a 
strong sympathy for a worthy sage—that is Su-fi. . • . 

A master, asked what Su-fi is, hits the questioner. He 
means by this, “Show me the pain and I will show you 
Su-fi." You say to master, 'Where did the light come 
from?" He blows it out He means: ‘You tell me where 
it is gone, and I will tell you where it came from " You 
cannot tell in words what you ask in words. . . . 

This may sound extremely Oriental to the Western 
reader, but the illustrations used (the pain and the candle) 
are not Far Eastern analogies at all. They come directly 
from the teachings of the ‘Western master," Rumi. The 
method of presentation of the ideas, rapid and parabolic, 
however, seem very Chinese. Yet they retain the spirit of 
the Sufi. 

It is Colonel Clarke's way of putting his impressions of 
the Sufis, however, which gives the more Western mind a 
chance to grasp what the orientation of the schools is, and 
produces an atmosphere which is necessary to the Western 
mind: 

“The sublime love poetry of the Sufi saints, the wholly 
practical nature of their teachings, the fervor allied with a 
deeply underlying sense of mission, of attainment of needs, 
both spiritual and physical, the confidence of the message 
and the future of the human race: these are some of the 
outstanding contributions of this wonderful body, admis¬ 
sion to whose numbers conveys the undoubted and abiding 
sensation of membership of an ancient elect." 5

Appendix I 

Esoteric Interpretation of the Koran 


For the Sufis of the classical period, the Koran is the en¬ 
coded document which contains Sufi teachings. Theologians 
tend to assume that it is capable of interpretation only in a 
conventionally religious way; historians are inclined to look 
for earlier literary or religious sources; others for evidence 
of contemporary events reflected in its pages. For the Sufi, 
the Koran is a document with numerous levels of transmis¬ 
sion, each one of which has a meaning in accordance with 
the capacity for understanding of the reader. It is this at¬ 
titude toward the book which made possible the understand¬ 
ing between people who were of nominally Christian, 
pagan or Jewish backgrounds—a feeling which the orthodox 
could not understand. The Koran in one sense is therefore 
a document of psychological importance. 

Chapter 112 of the Koran is an excellent example of this 
synthesizing capacity of the book. This is one of the shortest 
chapters, and it may be translated thus: 

Say, O messenger, to the people: 

“He, Allah, is Unity! Allah the Eternal. 

Fathering nobody, and not himself engendered— 

And absolutely nothing is like him!” 

For the devout and conventional Moslem this is the basic 
declaration of faith. Allah is God; He has no equal, is the 
Eternal. 

Christian commentators, from the earliest times, have con¬ 
sidered this passage to be a direct attack upon the doctrine 
of the divinity of Christ, and they wax very fierce about it 



APPENDIX I 


413 

It is one of the most quoted passages of the Koran, and 
millions of Moslems use it in their prayers every day. 

Viewed on this basis, the “chapter of the Unity” seems to 
draw a distinct line between the believers and the rest. The 
devout Moslem can use it against the Christian, whom he 
considers to be a heretic of the monotheistic tradition. The 
Christian reacts by considering it an insult to his central 
beliefs. Such a situation obtains, however, only where there 
is a certain psychological climate—a clash between two 
power groups which struggled during the middle ages for 
power in a medieval manner. 

If we accept these assumptions, we place ourselves within 
the conflict which, for the Sufi, never existed except for 
those who chose a conflict within this psychological state. 

Such an interpretation of the meaning of Chapter 112 
was never accepted by the Sufis. Setting aside the Sufi claim 
to be able to perceive the real meaning of this chapter, we 
can find a bridge between ordinary thinking and a possible 
intention of this passage by referring to the opinion of the 
great Ghazali about it. 

Like all the chapters of the Koran, he says, this one can¬ 
not be reduced to similarity with other books by assuming 
that it has a single, simple meaning of the sort familiar to 
the ordinary thinker. The Unity has no simple, single aim, 
no mere superficial meaning. Its impact depends upon 
understanding and experience, just as much as upon its 
poetic rhythm. 

He refers to the context in which the chapter was re¬ 
vealed. It was in answer, not to a Christian nor to a reli¬ 
gious man, but to a party of Bedouin Arabs who approached 
the Prophet Mohammed with this question: “To what may 
we compare Allah?” 

The answer is that Allah may not be compared to any¬ 
thing. There is no analogy possible between this being 
(Allah—that which is to be worshiped) and anything 
familiar to humanity. Allah is the word used to denote the 
final objectivity, uniqueness, something which has no rela- 


THE SUFIS 


414 

tionship with numbering, anything in time, anything which 
propagates in a sense familiar to man. 

It is on this level, not even an initiatory or mystical one, 
that the common ground between Moslems and Christians 
was laid. By understanding this we can much more easily 
understand how Sufism bridged the gap between the of¬ 
ficial interpretations of Christianity and Islam and the needs 
of the thinking man. 

This sense of the meaning of “Allah,” coupled with the 
original rhythm of the poetry, may be conveyed more 
readily by this sort of reconstruction: 

O Messenger- 

Say: “He, Allah, is but One! 

Of days neither ended nor begun, 

Fathering not, a son of none— 

And none is like to him, not one!” 

It is this spirit and this claim to the essential unity of 
divine transmission which is what has been referred to as 
the “secret doctrine.” 

Unless this feeling about the Koran is conveyed correctly, 
the inevitable conclusions about the limited clash between 
church Christianity and formal Islam becomes the only 
frame of reference for the scholar. It may give rise to such 
translations as the following, bereft of the Sufic connotation: 

“ALLAH is the One God; Unbegetting, Unbegotten, Un¬ 
equaled.” 



Appendix II 

The Rapidness 


There is no aspect of Sufism more attractive to the impatient 
than this. Considerable interest and excitement has been 
aroused since the 'rapid technique” of Sufi development 
was brought to India by Sheikh Shattar. 

"The Rapidness” (the Shattari Method) traditionally 
emanates from the Naqshbandi Order of Sufis, most widely 
distributed in Afghanistan, Turkestan, other parts of Cen¬ 
tral Asia, and Ottoman Turkey. Bahaudin Naqshband gave 
his name to this phase of Sufi teaching. He died in 1389. His 
chain of transmission reaches back to Mohammed, his com¬ 
panion Abu Bakr, Salman the Persian, the Sayed family 
and the Imams, and others, including Bayazid of Bistam 
(died 875), another of the greatest masters. 

Sheikh Abdullah Shattar visited India in the fifteenth 
century, wandering from one monastery to another, and 
made known the method. His procedure was to approach 
the chief of a Sufi group and say, "Teach me your method, 
share it with me. If you will not, I invite you to share mine.” 

Shattar died in the first quarter of the fifteenth century 
in India, and his successors powerfully influenced various 
Mogul emperors. One Shattari leader, Shah Gwath, was 
persecuted by the official religious authorities, but eventually 
enrolled their spokesman as a disciple. The Shattari Order 
ceased to be of any public account in the early nineteenth 
century of the present era, having—in Sufi parlance—be¬ 
come a mere self-perpetuating organization centered in 
Gujerat. The Shattari Methods, which have been stren¬ 
uously sought by Indian and other Seekers ever since, re¬ 
main in the custody of the Shattari-trained element of the 
Naqshbandi, the parent school. 


'Annotations 


Arab Diffusion in Europe 

The Western tradition of learning is as much a Saracen 
tradition as anything else; if by Saracen we mean the con¬ 
centration point, in Spain, Sicily and elsewhere, of the 
many stimuli which make up a great part of what is con¬ 
sidered to be an outgrowth of Greek and Latin culture. 

‘The period during which the literary scepter was held 
by France coincided with the growth and high development 
of the Arabist school of Montpellier, which came under the 
influence of the Arabized Jews of Spain. Montpellier, owing 
to its geographical relation to Andalusia on the one hand, 
and Sicily and the Italian peninsula on the other . . • 
drew numbers of students from the Latin West, who after 
having imbibed at the Arabized sources available at that 
time, once more scattered themselves in Europe, thus per¬ 
meating the whole fabric of medieval culture with the gloss 
of Arabian erudition. The subsequent teaching of the 
alumni of Montpellier, who exercised a dominating influ¬ 
ence over medical literature on the Continent and in Eng¬ 
land, is one of the outstanding historical facts of the middle 
ages. The newly developing varieties of romance, combined 
with the steady inpour of Arabic works from southern 
Spain, which were in the main rendered into indifferent 
Latin, rendered both the liquid languages and sciences (in¬ 
cluding medicine) particularly susceptible to Arabian in¬ 
fluences." (Dr. D. Campbell, Arabian Medicine, I, Lon¬ 
don, 1926, pp. 196-97) 

Ascent 

There are four major “conditions" of man. All mankind is 
in one of these. In accordance with these conditions, the 


ANNOTATIONS 417 

individual has to have his progress planned. He will behave 
in a different way, may appear a different person, will take 
decisions, according to the condition and the degree of that 
condition which he has attained. Not everyone reaches every 
stage of every condition, according to Sufi doctrine. The 
difference in Sufi formulation will depend upon the exist¬ 
ence of conditions of this kind, their completeness, and 
their relationship with all humanity. Shah Mohammed 
Gwath, in Secrets of the Naqshbandi Path, expresses the 
conditions in religious terms: 

!• Humanity (nasut ) 7 the ordinary condition. 

2. On the Path Qtarika), equated with “angels” in the 
cosmic sense. 

3 * Force, equated with what is called “power” 
Qabarut ), or real capacity. 

4. Absorption ( lahut ), referring to the condition of 
“divinity” in another sphere. 

The individual Sufi is concerned with passing from one 
stage of conditions to another. The teacher is responsible for 
making this possible through the training which he offers. 
The Guide is responsible for relating the individual progress 
to that of the total needs of humanity. Innumerable tech¬ 
niques and activities of the Sufis ultimately relate to the 
application of this concept. 

Baraka 

Root and Derivation ( Arabic) 

BaRK b- = to stand firm, dwell in. 

BaRK 'ala = to sit down. 

BaRRaK 1- = congratulate. (Syrian dialect) 

BaRRaK 'ala = to bless. 

TaBARaK = to be exalted. 

TaBaRRaK b- = to bode well of. 

BaRaK-at = blessing, abundance. 

BiRK-at = pool, tank, puddle. 

BaRIK = happy, fresh dates with cream. 



418 


THE SUFIS 


BaRRAK = miller. 

MuB ARaK = blessed. 

BaRRaK = make kneel down, bend the knees. 

The Italian Carbonari, originally a mystical fraternity, 
made use of the coincidence between the Arabic baraka and 
the Italian baracca . The latter means “a covering without 
walls, a barrack, storehouse, undertaking, enterprise.” They 
used it as the term for the Lodge. In July 1957, Mr. John 
Hamilton published in the Hibbert Journal a paper in 
which he proposed that the word baraka be used in English 
to denote certain qualities in people or objects, such as “the 
virtue emanated by Jesus and other great healers.” Professor 
Robert Graves independently advocated the same course 
in an important lecture in America. The word is familiar to 
many who have lived in the East, but has a meaning wider 
than its usual employment. President De Gaulle of Fiance, 
in saying, “I have baraka,” used it in the sense of personal 
invulnerability made necessary because of a sense of the 
need to complete a mission or function. 

Bedil 

Mirza Abdul-Qadir Bedil, who lived at the time of the 
Indian emperor Aurangzeb, is greatly admired as a Sufi 
teacher in India and Central Asia. A collection of thirty- 
one thousand of his extraordinarily originally constructed 
poems was published by a committee of savants in Afghani¬ 
stan in 1962. 

Black and Wise 

The idiomatic usage of the word “black” in Europe to de¬ 
note something unpleasant has obscured its special, techni¬ 
cal usage during the middle ages. Reference may be made to 
the use of the idea of “dark,” occult, for something hidden 
may form a bridge toward reestablishing the sense of this 
concept in its connection with hidden wisdom—and also, by 
extension, with leadership. The Kaaba (cubic temple, the 
Holy of Holies) in Mecca is draped in black, esoterically 


ANNOTATIONS 


419 

interpreted as a play upon words of the FHM sound in 
Arabic, alternatively meaning “black” or “wise,” “under¬ 
standing” The word sayed (prince) is connected with an¬ 
other root for black, the SWD root The original banner 
of the Prophet Mohammed was black, collectively standing 
for wisdom, lordship. The association of the ideas is not, 
of course, preserved in the translation of the Sufi phrases 
“In the darkness, the Path.” (Dar tanki, tariqat .) The 
black-and-white checker effect (light—understanding— 
comes from darkness) said to have been handed down to 
the Sufis from the very greatest antiquity, symbolizes this 
duality. In many ways, Sufi meetings ritualistically perpet¬ 
uate the alternation of light and darkness, of black and 
white. One such method is to lay cloth of alternate black 
and white on the floor of the meeting place. Another is to 
alternately kindle and extinguish a lamp. 

Classical Teachers 

There are three “generations” or “waves” of teachership 
during the classical period. All Sufis believe themselves to 
be recipients of the bardka accumulated by these teachers, 
who are thus their spiritual ancestors. 

In the first generation: Abu Bakr, Umar, AH, Bilal, Ibn 
Riyah, Abu Abdullah, Salman the Persian—the Seven Great 
Ones. 

In the second generation: Uways el Qami, Hiran ibn 
Haya, Hasan el-Basri; the Four Guides (“Crowns”). 

In the third generation: Habib Ajami, Mahk Ibn Dinar, 
Imam Abu Hanifa, Daud of Tai, Dhul-Nun the Egyptian, 
Ibraham Ibn Adam, Abu Yazid, Sari el-Saqti, Abu Hafa, 
Maaruf Karkhi, Junaid—the Eleven Sheikhly Transmitters, 
These are the masters who concentrated the teachings and 
passed them on in such a manner as to make possible the 
school developments which later appeared as dervish Orders. 

Confluence 

Just as students of comparative religion have noted similar- 



THE SUFIS 


420 

ities in the externals and doctrines of many faiths, in 
mysticism Sufism has continuously stressed the essential 
identity of the stream of transmission of inner knowledge. 
In the East the Mogul prince Dara Shikoh wrote the Con¬ 
fluence of the Two Seas, stressing the meeting between 
Sufism and early Hindu mysticism. The Rosicrudans in 
the West adopted almost literally the teaching of the Span¬ 
ish ill umini st Sufis in daiming an unbroken succession of 
inner teaching, in which they included “Hermes.” The 
Western illuminati induded Mohammed in their chain of 
transmitters. Count Michael Maier in 1617 wrote Symbola 
Aurea Mensae Duodedm Nationum (Contributions of 
Twelve Nations to the Golden Table), in which he showed 
that the Sufi tradition of a succession of teachers was still 
being maintained. Among the alchemical teachers were 
several whom the Sufis also recognize, including Westerners 
who had studied Saracen lore. They are: Hermes of Egypt, 
Mary the Hebrew, Democritus of Greece, Morienus of 
Rome, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) of Arabia, Albertus Magnus of 
Germany, Arnold of Villaneuve of France, Thomas Aquinas 
of Italy, Raymond Lully of Spain, Roger Bacon of England, 
Melchior Cibiensis of Hungary, and Anonymus Sarmata 
(Michael Sendivogius) of Poland. All Western alchemy, of 
course, is attributed by tradition to Geber (Jabir Ibn el- 
Hayyan) the Sufi. 

Consciousness 

The communication between minds which is established by 
Sufism has several aspects. By means of the tasarruf exer- 
dses, which “dear” the individuality, there is an interaction 
of minds. This is used by Sufis for purposes of healing, and 
it is through this technique that most of their inexplicable 
cures are effected, aside from the application of simpler 
techniques. (See J. Hallaji, “Hypnotherapeutic Techniques 
in a Central Asian Community,” International Journal of 
Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, October, 1962) Jung's 
theory of the collective unconscious is expounded by the 



ANNOTATIONS 421 

Spaniard Ibn Rushd (1126—1198). It was also often referred 
to by Rumi, and its meaning and force are subjects of Sufi 
specialization, Rumi notes that this phenomenon is one of a 
higher consciousness: “Animality has division in the spirit; 
the human spirit has one soul.” This is generally referred to 
as the “great soul.” 

Death and Rebirth 

The theme that man must “die before he dies” (Mohammed) 
or that he must be “bom again” in his present life is to be 
found in very many forms of initiatory observance. In al¬ 
most all cases, however, the message is taken symbolically, 
or is commemorated by a mere mime or ritual. The Sufis, 
believing that they preserve the original sense of this teach¬ 
ing, mark the three main grades of initiation with a “death” 
process. In this, the candidate has to pass through certain 
specific experiences (technically termed “deaths”). The ac¬ 
tual initiation ceremony merely commemorates this hap¬ 
pening, and does not simply dramatize it as a symbol. The 
three “deaths” are: 

1. The White Death 

2. The Green Death 

3. The Black Death 

Leading up to the spiritual experiences referred to as 
“deaths” are a series of psychological and other exercises 
which include three outstanding factors: 

i* Abstinence and control of physical functions. 

2. “Poverty,” including independence from material 
things. 

3. Emotional liberation through such exercises as over¬ 
coming avoidable obstacles, and “playing a part” in order to 
observe the reactions of others. 

Discipleship under a master follows a special pattern in 
which the Seeker is given opportunities for exercising his 
consciousness of these three stages. Since Sufism uses the 
normal organization of “the world” as a training ground, the 
three “deaths” always involve specific enterprises carried out 



THE SUEIS 


422 

in human society, leading to the spiritual experiences 
marked by the three “deaths” and successive “rebirth” or 
transformation which results from them. 

Dots 

Among the Sufis, NQT—“dot,” “point,” sometimes “abbre¬ 
viation”—has an important value in conveying teachings. In 
one aspect this is connected with the mathematical part of 
Sufism. The Arabic word for “geometrician” or “architect” 
is muhandis . It is composed of the letters M, H, N, D, S, 
which are equivalent to the numbers 40, 5, 50, 4, 60. These 
total 159. These numbers, resplit conventionally into tens, 
hundreds and units, yield 

100 = Q 
50 = N 
9 = T. 

These three consonants, combined in the order 2, 1, 3, 
provide the root NQT. This root means “dot,” “point.” In 
certain ceremonial usages, therefore, the word “point” is 
used to convey the concealed word which is its parent—the 
word muhandis, the Prime Builder. There are many other 
ingredients in this grouping of numbers. An example is 
this: The first two letters (Q,N) mean in Arabic “deep 
meditation,” a word for Sufism. The remaining letter, the 
T, stands in the Arab “occult” list for “inner knowledge.” 
Hence, in certain situations special dialogues are used. An 
example is when an individual at an early stage of member¬ 
ship is being tested for his formal knowledge of how the 
word code works. A certain dialogue may take place: 

Questioner: ,f What does the Geometrician mean?” 
Applicant: “I is represented by the dot (NQT).” 

Q: “How is it spelled?” 

A: “Like a dot” 

Q: ‘What comes after meditation (QN)?” 

A: ‘The inner knowledge (the letter T).” 




ANNOTATIONS 423 

Q: "Will you tell it to me?” 

A: "I have only two thirds—N and Q.” 

Q: “I have the third third—T, standing for 'hidden/ ” 

Elements of Sufism 

The Ten Elements of the Sufis refer to the framework of 
individual effort within which the Seeker gains the potential 
to become awake, or alive, in the greater dimensions which 
lie outside familiar experience. El-Farisi has listed them 
thus: 

1. Separation of unification. 

2. Perception of audition. 

3. Companionship and association. 

4. Correct preference. 

5. Surrender of choice. 

6. The rapid acquisition of a certain "state.” 

7. Penetration of thought, self-examination. 

8. Traveling and movement 

9. Surrender of earnings. 

10. Lack of acquisition or covetousness. 

Sufi exercises and training are based on these Ten Ele¬ 
ments. In accordance with the need of the disciple, the 
teacher will choose for him programs of study and action 
which give him the opportunity of exercising functions sum¬ 
marized by these Elements. These factors are therefore the 
basis of preparing the individual for the development which 
he could not otherwise sustain or perceive, let alone attain. 

Hafez 

Khaja Shamsuddin Hafiz (literally Master Sun of Faith, the 
Protector, he who knows the Koran by heart) died in 1389. 
One of the greatest of all Persian poets, his works are known 
as the Interpreter of the Secrets and the Speech of the In - 
visible . His collection, the Diwan, conceals, in seemingly 
sensual verse, many Sufi experiences. It is used as a text¬ 
book, and also (by the vulgar) for omens, by opening it 
at random. Originating in Isfahan, the family migrated to 



THE SUFIS 


424 

Shiraz. The date of his death is concealed in a poem which 
appears on his tomb, which itself gives the clue to the fact 
that it is concealed in the numerical cipher used by the 
Sufis: Tf thou would’st know when he sought a place in 
the dust of Musalla, seek the date in the dust of Musalla.” 
"Dust of Musalla” ( [khahi-Musdla ) decodes to the num¬ 
bers 791, the equivalent in the Moslem calendar for the 
year 1389. Hafiz was the teacher of kings and at the same 
time beloved of the people. His influence is still second to 
none in Persian literature. 

Hallaj 

Hussein Ibn Mansur el-Hallaj is the great martyr of the 
Sufis. Like many Adepts, he took as his surname a voca¬ 
tional name—Hallaj, the wool carder or cotton dresser— 
which has caused most commentators to assume that this 
was his trade or that of his family. The cloaking of Sufi 
groups and their assemblies within the cover of guild or¬ 
ganization is one of the reasons for the choice. Ghazali the 
Spinner and Attar the Chemist are other examples. But 
Sufis always chose vocational names which could be (by 
double meaning) associated with their Sufic commitment. 
Hallaj is chosen because of the association of wool (.suf) 
with the vocation; and also because an alternative meaning 
for the HLJ root in Arabic is either "to walk slowly” or "to 
let forth lightning.” 

Although known popularly as Mansur, this was actually 
the name of his father, a former Magian. He was executed 
in 922 for saying such things as "I am the Truth” QAna el- 
Haqq ), and refusing to recant, thus uttering the ultimate 
blasphemy. He was alleged to be an alchemist, like many 
Sufis, and extant hostile literature paints him as a wily pre¬ 
tender. For the Sufis, some of the greatest of whom were 
his friends and contemporaries, he is one of their greatest 
masters. 

He held secret meetings at his house, and became very 
powerful through his teaching and by performing miracles. 



ANNOTATIONS 425 

He was, in short, a political threat He taught that Sufism 
was the internal truth o£ all true religion, and because he 
emphasized the importance of Jesus as a Sufi teacher, he was 
accused by fanatics of being a secret Christian. One of the 
counts against him was that he had a number of books, 
wonderfully embellished and decorated. His assertion that 
the Mecca pilgrimage could be performed anywhere, by 
making suitable dedications and preparations, was con¬ 
sidered to be impossibly heretical. Hujwiri ([Revelation of 
the Veiled) authoritatively defends Hallaj on the grounds 
that things done or said by Sufis are not to be interpreted 
by lower criteria. The attempt to express Reality, he says, in 
ordinary terms, is an impossibility. Similarly, the attempt 
will not create the meaning. 

On Tuesday, March 26, 922, Hallaj walked to the place 
of his execution, condemned by the Inquisition of the 
Caliph el-Muqtadir. He was tortured and dismembered, but 
showed no fear. This was his last public prayer, while he 
could still speak: 

“O Lord, make me grateful for the barakct which I 
have been given in being allowed to know what others 
do not know. Divine mysteries which are unlawful to 
others have become thus lawful to me. Forgive and 
have mercy upon these Thy servants assembled here 
for the purpose of killing me; for, had Thou revealed 
to them what Thou hast revealed to me, they would not 
act thus" 

H ANTE’S 

The loss of the Sufic thread in many metaphysical schools, 
with the resultant failure of these schools to provide a real 
fulfillment for the followers, is considered by the Sufis to be 
one cause of the quest, the search for a teacher, which pre¬ 
occupied so many people in ancient times. Certain com¬ 
panions of Mohammed themselves described this quest as 
applied to themselves. One of them was Salman the Persian. 



426 THE SUFIS 

He related how he tired of the mere rituals of the Zoroas- 
trians, and set off southward seeking the faith and practice 
of the Hanifs. He attached himself first to a Christian 
teacher, then to another. When the latter died, he told 
Salman to journey southward in search of an exponent of 
the Hanifite lore. After being captured and sold into slavery 
he found the immediate circle of Mohammed's disciples at 
Medina. What was this practice of the Hanifs, which the 
Sufis equate with Sufism? 

The choice of this word, as with many others which are 
only attempts to convey a varied meaning with one root, 
is believed by the Sufis to explain itself. The triliteral root 
HNF is basically associated with the concept of ‘leaning 
on one side"—a reference to the rhythmic movements of 
the Sufis. A derivative of HNF is the form TaHaNNaF, 
which means “to act like a Hanifite;" and tahannaffi means 
“to do a thing accurately." Here we have a word picture of 
exercises performed according to a set plan; but also 
potentially “on one side"—which Sufis teach means in an 
eccentric as well as rhythmic manner. The word hanif, also 
from the same root, is the noun. It also stands for straight¬ 
forwardness. Such a variety of meanings would seem 
baffling if it were not realized that such ideas as “to do a 
thing accurately" and “to lean on one side" can be equated 
within a certain system—that of the Sufis. This is not to say, 
of course, that the root form was invented by the Sufis; or 
even that the words are not in everyday use in straightfor¬ 
ward meanings. The important thing to note is that for the 
Sufis certain words are chosen to describe a complex of ideas 
which accord with a number of Sufi ideas and practices, 
and build up, on close examination, a word picture. 

It is as if we were to take a word in English, one with a 
number of meanings, and use it because within the mean¬ 
ings were found several which, taken together, carried a 
message or composite presentation of certain essentials. This 
procedure is rather more elaborate than punning or simple 



ANNOTATIONS 


4 2 7 

rhyme. It extends the dimensions of meaning, as it were, 
through the word and its derivatives. 

Hidden Sufis 

There are several forms of invisible saints (“friends”) cor¬ 
responding with the general human need for a certain 
representation of psychic or psychological activity in the 
whole community, according to Sufi teaching. Hujwiri (Rev- 
elation of the Veiled , Nicholson's version, p. 213) says: 
“Among them there are four thousand who are concealed 
and do not know one another and are not aware of the ex¬ 
cellence of their state, but in all circumstances are hidden 
from themselves and from mankind. Traditions have come 
down to this effect, and the sayings of the saints proclaim 
the truth thereof, and I myself—God be praised!—have had 
ocular experience of this matter.” 

E. H. Whinfield ( Mathnawi , London, 1887, p. xxvii et 
seq.) related this concept more closely with current ideas as 
to who or what such people might be: 

“A very remarkable doctrine is that of unrecognized saints. 
There are always on earth four thousand persons who are, 
so to speak, saints without knowing it. These are they who 
are bom with a natural goodness, which lifts them without 
effort to a point that most labor to reach in vain—loyal, 
gentle, unselfish souls, endowed with a natural intuition of 
good and a natural inclination to pursue it, the stay and 
comfort of those who enjoy the blessing of their society, 
and, when they have passed away, perhaps canonized in 
the hearts of one or two who loved them. Spontaneous good¬ 
ness of this sort is not to be submitted to rules or forms; the 
inward inclination, not the outward ordinances, is the 
source of their goodness. Against such there is no law/ 
They have a standard of thought and character of their 
own, quite independent of the praise or blame of men of 
externals.' ” 

Sufi teaching accords such people a place in the total 
evolutionary pattern of mankind.

THE SUFIS 


Jami 

Mulla Nurudin Abdarahman Jami (literally Master Light 
of Faith, Servant of the Merciful, of Jam) was bom in 
Khurasan in 1414 and died in Herat in 1492. Jami was 
spiritualized by the glance of the great Master Mohammed 
Parsa, who passed through his birthplace when the poet 
was a small boy, according to his own belief. He was 
a teacher of the Naqshbandi Order. His Sufi teachings are 
sometimes displayed, sometimes concealed, in his extraor¬ 
dinary poetical and other works. Among these are the 
romances of Salman and Absal and the epic of Joseph and 
Zuleikha, allegorical tales which are among the greatest 
pieces of Persian literature ever written. His Abode of 
Spring contains the most important initiatory material. Jami 
was a great traveler, theologian, hagiographer, grammarian 
and prosodist, as well as a musical theorist. His intellectual 
powers were such that after studying under the Master 
Ali of Samarkand he was soon recognized by the great 
doctor Rum as superior to him. Addressing a great assembly, 
he said, "Since the building of this city none equal in mind 
and the use of it to this youth Jami has ever crossed the Oxus 
to Samarkand.” Jami chose his place-name as a pseudonym 
because it decodes to the numbers 54, reencodable to the let¬ 
ters ND. This combination of letters in Arabic stands for a 
group of ideas—idol, opponent, running, compounded per¬ 
fume-all Sufi poetic concepts connected with the "state” 
or "movement” of the Sufi. 

Languages 

Many of the Adepts of Sufism, though well versed in 
Arabic, have refused to use it except when they desire to 
use it for a specific purpose. They traditionally adhere to 
this practice even in circles where a knowledge of Arabic 
is considered to be essential to a cultivated man. As a con¬ 
sequence, some even of the very greatest masters have from 



ANNOTATIONS 


429 

time to time been considered insufficiently educated by 
literary observers. There are many stories about this subject. 
The reasons for not using Arabic are: (O If the Sufi is 
following at the time the “path of blame/' he finds it neces¬ 
sary to incur certain feelings of opposition in his hearers. 
This is best done, in the case of a highly language-conscious 
people like the Arabs, by not speaking their language—from 
their point of view a serious shortcoming. (2) Because of 
the fixed idea of Arabic supremacy, the Sufi has to detach 
the individual from the assumption that all great men must 
speak Arabic. (3) The Sufi cannot be forced into the 
scholastic culture pattern devised by others, without com¬ 
promising his own teachings. (4) There are distinct cir¬ 
cumstances when communication on a verbal basis, by 
familiar methods, is not indicated. The Sufi's “state" tells 
him what this is. In the case of the ordinary man, such a 
refinement of perception is not possible, and he therefore 
strives unthinkingly to communicate information and ideas 
on the basic assumption that when people meet, their 
identity of linguistic ability is a good and necessary thing. 

The great Sufi and great Sheikh of Khurasan Abu-Hafs 
el-Haddadi knew no Arabic, it was reported. 1 He spoke 
through interpreters. When he went to Baghdad to visit 
such giants as Junaid, he spoke so eloquently in Arabic that 
he had no equal. This is a typical story. The Sufi, for whon* 
Sufism is more important than anything else, will embody 
in his own self-development a technique of this kind, an4 
combine it with the impact which he is making upon others, 
It is never his aim to further his own reputation in academic 
circles. Those who have viewed Sufism as a Persian cult 
whose practitioners harbored animosity toward the Arabs 
and sought to reduce the importance of Arabic as one of 
their techniques completely misunderstand the role of 
language in Sufism. Similar techniques are reported in the 
use of languages other than Arabic.

THE SUFIS 


Latah* 

The activation of the special Organs of Perception (lataif) 
is a part of Sufi methodology analogous to, and often con¬ 
fused with, the chakra system of the Yogis. There are im¬ 
portant differences. In Yoga, the chakras or padmas are con¬ 
ceived as physically located centers in the body, linked by 
invisible nerves or channels. Yogis generally do not know 
that these centers are merely concentration points, con¬ 
venient formulations whose activation is part of a theoretical 
working hypothesis. Both Sufism and Christianity of an 
esoteric sort preserve a similar theory, combining it with 
certain exercises. The succession of colors seen by the 
alchemist in the Western literature can be seen as referring 
to concentration upon certain physical localizations if we 
compare it with the Sufi literature on exercises. This is sur¬ 
prisingly easily demonstrated, though it seems that nobody 
in the West has noticed the connection. In Sufism, the 
lataif are located thus: Mind ( qalb), color yellow, loca¬ 
tion left side of the body. Spirit (rah), color red, location 
right side of the body. Consciousness (sirr), color white, 
location solar plexus. Intuition ( khafi ), color black, location 
forehead. Deep perception of consciousness (ikhfa ), color 
green, location center of chest. In Western alchemy, the 
“succession of colors manifested” is of very great impor¬ 
tance. Among the Christian alchemists the succession black- 
white-yellow-red is very common. It will at once be noted 
that this succession, transposed into physical equivalents, 
forms the sign of the Cross. The alchemical exercises there¬ 
fore aim at activating colors (locations = lataif ) in the 
form of crossing oneself. This is an adaptation of the Sufi 
method which is thus, in order of activation: yellow-red- 
white-black-green. In alchemy, again, the succession is 
sometimes given as black (subsidiary gray = partial devel¬ 
opment of the black faculty, the forehead)—white (solar 
plexus, the second point of the sign of the Cross)—green 
(a Sufi alternative for the right side of the chest)—citrine 



ANNOTATIONS 431 

(left side of the chest, “heart”)—red (right side of the 
chest). Sometimes, as the second stage, the “peacock” 
(variegated colors) appears in the consciousness. This sign, 
considered important to the alchemists, is known by the 
Sufis as a special condition, not invariable, which occurs 
in the mind when the consciousness is flooded by changing 
colors or photisms. It is a stage before stabilization of the 
consciousness, and can in some ways be compared to color 
illusions produced by hallucinogens. The Sufis wear cloth¬ 
ing (often turbans) of the color corresponding to their de¬ 
velopment in this special system. Literary students of 
alchemy are left fumbling with a mystery which is thus not 
complicated if understood in its real meaning. 

Light Verse 

The Verse of Light from the Koran (Sura 24, verse 35) 
itself states that it is an allegory and that its inner meaning 
must be understood metaphorically. 

The idea of illuminism, and especially the analogy of the 
Lamp in Sufism and its derivatives, comes from this verse. 
It is the transmitting of the meaning of the Lamp allegory 
which forms a part of Sufi esoteric development, because 
the Lamp has to be experienced, as soon as the individual 
consciousness is capable of perceiving it 
This is the Verse of Light: 

ALLAH is the Light of the heavens and earth. His 
light is resembled by a lamp within a niche. The lamp 
is within a crystal, like a shining Star. It is lit from a 
blessed olive tree, not of the East or the West; of it the 
oil itself nearly shines, without the effect of any fire. 
Light upon Light! 

This mystical passage gives the essence of Sufism, and 
conceals the nature of the cognition of the extra dimen¬ 
sions of the human consciousness which comes beyond the 
intellect 



THE SUEIS 


432 

It is the subject of the great Ghazali's Niche for Lights, 
a Sufi classic* 

Miramolin 

The medieval rendering of the Arab title Emir el-Mominin 
(Commander of the Faithful, Caliph) of Spain and Africa 
was Miramolin, an attempt to reproduce the sound of the 
original words. Vulgarly, looked at from the point of view 
of Spanish, the word sounds as if it was composed of the 
words "to look” ( mirar ) and "a mill” ( molino ). Trans¬ 
posing this idea of "mill” into Arabic, as it was explained 
to me by the Moorish descendant of Spanish Arabs expelled 
in the 1490s, we find the word rahu What else does ruhi 
mean in Arabic? 

RAHI: Mill; the thick of a fight; chief of a tribe; troop 
of camels. 

MIRAt means "stores, wheat.” 

The mill which Quixote attacked was, by linguistic 
analogy and coincidence, a mill, but it also stood for * the 
thick of a fight; chief of a tribe,” etc. 

It is impossible to transpose the associations into Eng¬ 
lish, because the humor depends upon the coincidence of 
sounds. Since Arabic is not now widely known in Spain, 
this part of the Spanish-Arabic literary interchange cannot 
take place any longer, and remains only with a few people 
in Morocco. 

The Miramolin of Africa, representing the fanatical ele¬ 
ment of Islam, was unpopular (to say the least) among the 
Spanish Arabs and the Sufis. 

Mysterious Festivals 

The mysterious "witch” festivals were held on the second of 
February, first of May, first of August and first of November. 
They do not accord with the seasons nor the solstices as far 
as most commentators can make out. It has therefore been 
concluded that they must be based upon some ancient 
calendar of animal breeding. These are, in fact, the dates 



ANNOTATIONS 


433 

which are celebrated by the Aniza (and other Arabs) 
heralding the changes of season observed in the Persian 
Gulf area and still observed there. They correspond exactly 
with: 

Spring, Rabi’ 

Summer, Saif 
Autumn, KJmrif 
Winter, Shita 

The “witch” habit of counterclockwise circumambula- 
tion, generally considered to be an evil reversal of normal 
religious clockwise movement, is similar to the Islamic habit 
of walking around the Kaaba. The Sufis and other Moslems 
are the only religious group which conducts their worship 
by means of a widdershins rotation. 


Naqshbandi 

One of the most widespread of the Sufi Orders. The name 
is literally Painters, on the analogy of the corporations or 
guilds of the early classical Sufis, such as the Builders. The 
Order has an inner and an overt branch. Many Persian 
poets use the word naqsh (diagram, painting, map, etc.) to 
denote a relationship between these Sufis and the whole 
“plan” of human development which Sufism is believed to 
be aiding. Rumi uses the word NQSH long before the sup¬ 
posed founder of the Order (Bahaudin Naqshband) taught 
in Bokhara. He says, “I am a form-making engraver (Na- 
QQASH), each instant I shape an idol.” ( [Diwan ) Khay¬ 
yam, even earlier, uses the same imagery: “This circle of 
the world is like a ring; assuredly we are the seal (NQSH) 
on its bezel.” The Naqshbandi trace their spiritual pedigree 
to Mohammed through most of the early classical teachers. 
The Order considers itself a Sufi influence, only partly ex¬ 
pressed in its outward form as a dervish school of austere 
appearance, helping to maintain the cultural identity of 
the environment. It was powerful in Turkey until the 
republican revolution, and dominated both the Ottoman and 


THE SUFIS 


434 

Mogul courts from time to time. The temporary character 
of Sufi schools, which causes their reshaping and difference 
in appearance in various fields, is referred to by Rumi when 
he says, “I am not of water or fire, nor of the headkilling 
wind. I am not of the impressed (MUNaQQiSH) day: I 
have laughed at all of them.” (Diwan) 

Nonrationai, Concern 

The individual reared in a Western cultural setting is often 
at a disadvantage when faced with the problem of learning, 
because of his preoccupation with the question of "domi¬ 
nate or be dominated,” to which he gives intense and un¬ 
discriminating emphasis. He is often aware of the "problem” 
in only the crude form ("dominate or be dominated”), and 
his literary and philosophical roots give him little ability to 
realize that the problem is centered around the assumption 
that there is no more rarefied possibility than "struggle or 
be struggled against.” Some Western observers have no¬ 
ticed this essential crisis. Under the heading of "Nonra- 
tional Concern,” the editors of a recent symposium 1 refer 
to this inherent characteristic: 

". . . the inability to make others fulfill one’s wishes; and 
the reverse, the fear of being controlled by others, with the 
consequent loss of the autonomy that is believed to be funda¬ 
mental to the conception of the self. These opposites are 
incongruously exaggerated in paranoid thinking, one of the 
most prevalent mental symptoms of Western man.” 

NSHR 

NaSHaR = to expand, spread, display 
NaSHaR = to saw wood; scatter; propagate 
NaSHaR = to become green after rain; to spread

ANNOTATIONS 


435 

NaSHr = life; sweet smell; reviving herbage after rain 
YaUM El-NNuSHUR = day of resurrection 
NuSHARa = sawdust 
MiNSHAR = saw 

Ibn El-Arabia poetic name derived from the same root 
as the noun “saw” and was chosen in accordance with Sufi 
usage. His Sufic mission combined, as we see from the above 
list of dictionary derivations of the original NSHR root, 
the dissemination of Sufism, the revival of knowledge, the 
refreshing influence of rain (bardka) upon herbage. “Saw¬ 
ing wood” is also taken to refer to the effort which is put 
into the life of the Sufi, as well as the production of some¬ 
thing new (sawdust) from the material worked upon 
(wood); a variation of the transmutation or “formation” 
analogy used by the Sufis. In alchemy there was chemical 
transmutation; in the QLB root (q.v.) there was the sense 
of “shaping, forming”; in the NSHR root there is the sense 
of production, sawdust. The allegory is, of course, of human 
change, and while the Sufis have kept the concept flexible, 
in other societies a single aspect (such as alchemy and 
transmutation) has become fixated and devoted entirely to 
the limited concept of alchemicalization. 

Objectives of Sufism 

Dazzled by the outward mystery of Eastern life, or involved 
in the intricacies of literature soaked in theological and 
historical allegory, most Western students of the Sufis, 
particularly the academicians, seem to pause at an earlier 
stage of experience of Sufi intention than would profit them. 
A recent (1962) traveler in North Africa, who spent some 
time with Sufis, brings back from Tunisia a sense of ob¬ 
jective which may sound strange to the traditional scholar: 

The disciples had to carry out memorizing and medita¬ 
tive exercises, developing powers of concentration and 
reflection. The others, it seemed, were keeping up a 



THE SUFIS 


436 

sort of training of which thought and work, as well as 
exercises like the dhihr, all formed a part. 

After a few days, the air of mystery and strangeness 
which I had felt was replaced by a sensation that, how¬ 
ever unfamiliar these practices might seem to the out¬ 
sider, their practitioners did not regard them as super¬ 
natural, as we might use the term. As Sheikh Arif once 
said: “We are doing something which is natural, which 
is the result of research and practice into the future 
development of mankind; we are producing a new man. 
And we do it for no material gain.” This, then, is their 
attitude. (O. M, Burke, “Tunisian Caravan,” Black¬ 
wood's Magazine, No. 1756, Vol. 291 (February, 1962), 

P* 135 ) 

Outlook 

Since Sufism is based upon the realization of truth by the 
Sufis, its outlook cannot change, though its superficial 
projection may appear to change. Teaching methods differ 
in accordance with cultural conditions. In other systems, it 
is the outlook of the philosophical school which undergoes 
variation. This “has a great significance in attesting to the 
ancient roots of the Sufi Way. It indicates that whereas in 
the progress of history the outlook of other philosophical 
doctrines has changed according to environments, the Sufi 
ideals have remained patent to the original form in adhering 
to the conception of a comprehensiveness without a fron¬ 
tier.” (The Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, Islamic Sufism &gt; London, 

1933 . P- 10) ... 

Accustomed to looking at philosophy as a makeshift, a 
groping toward truth, changing in accordance with the ac¬ 
quisition of mere information, there are few people nowa¬ 
days who can even grasp the assertion that there is an 
ultimate truth against which everything can be measured, 
and which is accessible to man.

Peacock Angel Cult 

The Yezidis, reputed devil worshipers, of Iraq, are a secret 
cult whose symbolism, the peacock and the black snake, 
have baffled students for centuries. There is, however, no 
need for this difficulty, given the knowledge that the group 
was founded by a famous Sufi, and given that we know how 
Sufic poetic analogy works. Like the Sufi Builders, travelers 
or Coalmen, the Yezidis were originally a community of 
Sufis, and their rituals are centered around the use of 
standard and familiar Sufi symbolism. 

Malak tauus, which stands for Peacock Angel, merely 
means: MaLaK, homonym of MaLiK ("King,” the tradi¬ 
tional word for a Sufi); and TAUUS (Peacock), which 
stands here for its homophone TAUUS (Verdant Land). 
When it is noted that MaLaK (Angel) is used in Ghazali’s 
sense of "angels are the higher faculties in man,” it can be 
seen that the supposed idol of the Yezidis is merely an al¬ 
legory of two Sufi watchwords—the expansion of the 
“land,” the mind, through the higher faculties. Both of these 
words are in Sufic usage outside of the Yezidi cult. The 
Yezidis are divided into grades which use Sufi initiatory 
titles such as pir (elder); Fakir (poor one); Baba (chief). 

Lady Drawer, who studied the Peacock people of Iraq at 
dose range, says of the founder of the group, Sheikh Adi 
Ibn Musafir (Son of the Traveler, a Sufi cognomen): 
‘Nothing that is known about him speaks of anything but 
orthodoxy, but he was a Sufi, and the secret doctrines of 
Sufism have always been suspected of pantheism, and the 
Sufi sects of cherishing andent faiths.” (Peacock Angel, 
London, I941, p. 152) 

In addition to the peacock emblem, the Yezidis use the 
figure of a snake, which they blacken with soot. This black¬ 
ening is symbolic of the word FEHM (charcoal, carbon). 
The snake itself, far from bdng a symbol of evil or andent 
skin-sloughing-regeneration lore, as some would believe, is 
chosen for the same reasons as the peacock In Arabic, 



438 THE SUEIS 

snake is HaYYat. This is a near rhyme for another word, 
HaYYAt, life, which uses the same Arabic letters. The mean¬ 
ing of the black snake is therefore: “Wisdom of Life.” 

As in the case of other Sufic organizations, the Yezidi 
system has traveled far beyond its cultural context, and be¬ 
come in places a mere mime. A thriving branch of the cult, 
which does in fact appear to revere an “angelic peacock,” 
is reported as existing in London in 1962. (A. Daraul, 
Secret Societies, London, 1962) 

It is this deterioration of symbolology which is reflected 
in many strange associations in the West The real develop¬ 
mental intention has become subservient to the form, which, 
in turn, is used to produce communal emotion, replacing 
inner experience. 

QALB 

The Arabic word QLB is not confined in meaning to the 
form QaLB (heart), which is one of its most familiar forms. 
In the Sufi sense, QLB is considered to have the following 
meanings, all straightforward dictionary derivations of this 
triliteral root: 

QaLaB = to turn a thing upside-down. A reference to 
the Sufi dictum: 'The world is upside down.” 

QaLaB = to extract the marrow of a palm tree. The palm 
tree, as noted elsewhere, is the Sufi term for bar aha and the 
magic square of fifteen, which contains Sufi diagrammatic 
and mathematical material. The “marrow” is used in the 
sense of the essence, vital portion. 

QaLaB = to become red. Applied to dates, the product of 
the palm. An allegory of a Sufi process, later associated with 
the alchemical idea of the “red elixir.” 

AQLaB = to be baked on one side. Used for bread, and 
in a special Sufi sense, denoting a part of a developmental 
process of transformation, analogized with turning one 
thing (dough) into what seems to be another (bread). 

TaqaLLaB = to be restless. Used of a sleeper, turning in 
his sleep. Used as a Sufi technical term to describe the un- 



ANNOTATIONS 


439 

certainty felt by the ordinary man who is, according to the 
convention used by the Sufis, 'asleep/' 

QaLB = reverse; invert; wrong side. This is also as¬ 
sociated with "molding” and a matrix (QALiB), the forma¬ 
tive apparatus. 

QaLB = heart, mind, soul; intimate thought; marrow, 
pith; best part. Also used in the compound phrase qalb el- 
muqaddas, literally "the Sacred Heart,” meaning the part of 
mankind which partakes of the essence of divinity. 

The letters Q + L + B add up to 132, equal to the name 
Mohammed (M-f-H + M + M-b D), the Logos or es¬ 
sence of Mohammed. Thirty-two plus one hundred (Q) 
make up one third of the total of divinity, the "ninety-nine 
names of beauty.” 

Qutub 

This is the reputed invisible head of all the Sufis. The word 
literally means the Magnetic Pole, Pivot, Polestar, Chief. 
Transposed into figures, it totals m—the thrice-repeated 
unity, the threefold unity, the threefold affirmation of truth, 
which is a unity. If this is split up into 100, 10, 1, and sub¬ 
stituted, we get the letters Q, Y and A. The word QYAA, 
spelled from these letters, means "to be vacant, voided.” It is 
the vacant, voided, purged "house” into which the baraka 
descends (the human consciousness). 

Raymond Lully 

I am indebted to Mr. Robert Pring-Mill of Oxford for a 
textual quotation from Lully's Blanquema , in which he 
states that he has adopted devotional methodology from the 
Sufies,” called by him religious men among the Saracens. 
(Communication dated June 26, 1962, quoting the Els 
Nostres Classics edition of Lully's L. de Evast e Blanquema, 
Vol. 3, p. ioetseq.) 

Remembering 

The word dhikr (pronounced in non-Arab countries as 


THE SUEIS 


440 

zikr ) refers to certain exercises carried out from the begin¬ 
ning of dervishhood. Basically the word means remem¬ 
brance,” and the sense is of remembering, commemorating, 
invocation. "Remembering” is now also defined as the basic 
term for the religious activity of dervishes. The first stage 
is remembering oneself, after which the function shifts to 
one of harmony with the greater consciousness. The disciple 
has to remember or recognize himself in various ways, shed¬ 
ding this exercise in this form very early, or it becomes an 
"undesirable cause.” Some imitators of Sufism, seeing Sufi 
assemblies, have copied this technique. The great Hakim 
Sanai warns against too much remembering, pointing out 
that it is used only at the early stage: 

Zikr juz dar rahi mujahid nisti 

Zikr dar majlisi mushahid nist . 

"Remembering exists not except in the way of struggle; 
Remembering, repetition is not to be found in the assembly 
of experience.” (The Walled Garden of Truth ) 

Rose; Rosicrucian; Rosary 

The Christians adopted the rosary from the Saracens. In so 
doing, they translated the word el-wardia (literally the 
reciter) by another word, almost the same in the original 
sound, a word standing for "roser,” or "rosary.” The full 
Arabic term for the rosary is el-mishat ePwirdiat (the 
Praiser of the Reciter or of the Drawing Near). This term 
(WRD) is a special technical term for the special exercises 
of the Sufis or dervishes. The Catholic rendering into Latin 
is not so much a mistranslation as an adoption of the Sufi 
poetic (or almost heraldic) method of using a similar word 
to create a picture. Hence the word wird (dervish exercise) 
was used by the Sufis poetically as WaRD (rose). A similar 
development took place with the term "Rosicrucian. This 
is a direct translation of the root WRD plus the word for 
"cross” in Arabic, SLB. In its original meaning, the phrase 
means WRD (exercise) plus SLB-"to extract the marrow ” 



ANNOTATIONS 441 

Hence it is only incidentally that SLB (which also means 
cross ) occurs in the phrase “Rosicrucian.” Taking advan¬ 
tage of this coincidence or poetic juxtaposition, the Sufis do, 
however, say, “We have the marrow of the Cross, while the 
Christians only have the crucifix,” and similar phrases. This 
loses its meaning in translation. A whole dervish Order 
(that of Abdul-Qadir el-Jilani) is formed around the idea of 
Rose in this initiatory sense, and its founder is called the 
Rose of Baghdad. Ignorance of this background is respon¬ 
sible for much useless speculation about such entities as the 
Rosicrucians who merely repeated in their claims the pos¬ 
session of the ancient teaching which is contained in the 
parallel development called alchemy, and which was also 
announced by Friar Bacon, himself claimed as a Rosicrucian 
and alchemist and illuminate. The origins of all these 
societies in Sufism is the answer to the question as to which 
of them did Bacon belong, and what the secret doctrine 
really was. Much other Rosicrucian symbolism is Sufic. 
Martin Luther used the Rose, Cross and Ring (Sufic halka 
group) in his emblem. This must have been supplied to him 
by an initiate Sufi. 

The Sacked Language 

Classical Arabic is that version of Arabic which was used 
by the Koreshite tribe, hereditary guardians of the Temple 
of Mecca, and to which Mohammed belonged. Long before 
Arabic became considered a holy tongue because it is the 
vehicle of the Koran, it was the speech of the sacerdotal class 
of Mecca, a sanctuary whose religious history legend starts 
with Adam and Eve. Arabic, most precise and primitive of 
the Semitic languages, shows signs of being originally a 
constructed language. It is built up upon mathematical 
principles—a phenomenon not paralleled by any other lan¬ 
guage. Sufic analysis of its basic concept groupings shows 
that especially initiatory or religious, as well as psycholog¬ 
ical, ideas are collectively associated around a stem in seem- 
ingly logical and deliberate fashion which could hardly be 



THE SUFIS 


442 

fortuitous. Arabic is the nearest that is available to a parent 
Semitic language, because philologically it is millennia more 
archaic than, for instance, Hebrew. For this reason, Hebrew 
grammar is based upon an analysis of Arabic, by a study of 
which the original meanings of Hebrew words, perverted 
through long literary usage, were reclaimed by Hebrew 
scholars. 

St. Augustus® 

It has been the custom among most Christian apologists to 
represent the religion, and especially their own branch of 
it, as time-centered, referring back to a certain historical 
f ac t—the human transition of Jesus. Other versions of the 
Christian story are labeled heresies. St. Augustine, who is 
explained away as being tainted with unchristian (i«e., non- 
conventional) philosophy, said, ^That which is called the 
Christian religion existed among the ancients and never 
did not exist from the beginning of the human race. 
(Epistolae lib. I, xiii, p. 3) The deviation of Christianity 
from the rest of human religion was, of course, the result 
of a deliberate choice—the decision to regard the events of 
the life and death of Christ as unique, not as part of a con¬ 
tinuous process. It must clearly be remembered that the ver¬ 
sions of Christianity most generally available to the average 
student are those which have prevailed, being most success¬ 
ful, not necessarily the most accurate, historically or other¬ 
wise. 


The Cupbearer, to whom so many Sufi verses are addressed, 
is generally considered by literary critics to be an imaginary 
figure. In Sufi practice, however, poems which are addressed 
to a Said, or in which a Saki appears, may refer to an in¬ 
dividual who plays an illustrative part in the proceedings, 
because a poem may not stand on its own under all circum¬ 
stances. When intended to fulfill a certain function, an 
actual Saki may be present. 



ANNOTATIONS 


443 

Outside of Sufi activity, there are few notices of the 
presence of a Saki. Sirajudin Ali refers to a Sufi meeting of 
this kind, when he reports a dialogue between a Saki and a 
Sufi master (Lai-Khur): 

In the Afghan town of Ghazna there was a “madman” 
called Lai-Khur who used to say the most outrageous things 
—the Sufi method of attracting attention to something in 
order to put a point. One day toward the middle of the 
twelfth century the poet Sanai was walking to the court of 
Sultan Ibrahim, scourge of the Hindus, to present him 
with an eulogistic poem on the eve of another expedition 
into infidel India. 

Sanai heard singing from a garden. As he listened, he 
heard the madman calling the Saki to bring wine—for a 
toast to the blinding of Sultan Ibrahim. The Saki objected 
to the toast. Was Ibrahim not a great monarch? “He is 
blind,” said the madman, “to quit this wonderful city to 
engage upon a useless task—especially when he is needed 
here.” 

The next toast was to Sanai, the eavesdropper himself, 
and to his “blindness.” The Said again said that this must be 
wrong, for Sanai was an excellent poet, a learned man. 
“Sanai,” said the madman, “has no idea why he was created. 
When his actions are asked, he will produce only eulogies 
of kings. This is what he has done during this life of his.” 

This account of the conversion of Sanai to Sufism is, of 
course, a report of a dialogue of a Sufic nature, presented 
in a formalized fashion. Since the Said’s words are never in¬ 
cluded in the written form of the poems, we have no re¬ 
corded dialogue form commemorating such encounters; and 
as far as tie ordinary literary man is concerned, they do 
not exist,

power groups. Charlemagne, the hero of Christendom, 
fought as an ally with a Moslem sovereign. Abdurahman 
II of Spain (821-852) sent an ambassador—Yahya the 
Gazelle—to a Norman king. Richard the Lionhearted 
(Arabic qalb el-nimr, both Sufi initiatory words) is said to 
have proposed that his sister should marry the brother of 
Saladin. She was herself the widow of the King of Sicily, 
whose rulers were using Sufi phrases in heraldic devices. 
The Lionhearted's brother, John (excommunicated 1209) 
sent an embassy from England to the Spanish-Moroccan 
Commander of the Faithful, offering to embrace Islam. 
Richard himself married (in 1191) Berengaria of Navarre, 
whose brother, Sancho the Strong, was a close ally of the 
Spanish Arabs. John was in 1211 preparing to give military 
support to the Albigensians, who were undoubtedly satu¬ 
rated with Sufic culture. Isabella of Castile was married to 
Edmund of Yorke; she was descended from Mohammed II 
of Seville. The Sufi influence which came from Spain at 
this time includes Morris dancing. John of Gaunt, who 
probably brought the dancers, was a patron of Chaucer, 
who used Sufi materials. Chaucer's wife Philippa was prob¬ 
ably Gaunt's third wife, whom Gaunt married in 1396. The 
lords of Aragon were directly descended from the Moslem 
kings of Granada. There are said to be 50,000 English 
descendants of the Beni Omeyya today, from the line of 
Pedro the Cruel. Thomas k Becket (111^-1170), Chancel¬ 
lor and Archbishop of Canterbury, whose doings and death 
are linked with speculation as to his spiritual commitment 
and have given rise to numerous theories, is said to have 
had a Saracen mother (Hitti, op. tit., p. 652, note 7). Shams 
el-Doha is the Arabic name of an English or Scottish 
princess who was married to the Moroccan sovereign Abu 
el-Hasan (1330-1380), the Mirinid; both have tombs in 
the ruins of Shilla, near Rabat. The Greek emperor John 
Cantacuzenus gave his daughter to the Turkish sovereign 
Orkhan in 1346. Orkhan organized the Janissaries, an elite 
military organization owing allegiance to the Sufi teacher

Haji Bektash. From the Islamic point of view there is no 
possibility of Moslem women being offered to unbelievers, 
and that such marriages took place or were mooted is con¬ 
firmation of the Eastern tradition that there was an ini¬ 
tiatory understanding between the Moslems of the time and 
the nominal Christians with whose families they were thus 
closely allied. Both current prudence and subsequent reli¬ 
gious propaganda have effaced public acknowledgment of 
this. 

Seven Men 

Sufi development requires the Seeker to pass through seven 
stages of preparation, before the individuality is ready for 
its full function. These stages, sometimes called “men,” are 
degrees in the transmutation of the consciousness, the 
technical term for which is nafs, breath. Briefly, the stages 
of development, each making possible a further enrichment 
of the being under the guidance of a practiced teacher, are: 

1. Nafs-i-ammara (the depraved, commanding nafs) 

2. Nafs-i-lawwama (the accusing nafs ) 

3. Nafs-i-mulhama (the inspired nafs ) 

4. Nafs-i-mutmainna (the serene nafs ) 

5. Nafs-i-radiyya (the fulfilled nafs) 

6. Nafs-jrmardiyya (the fulfilling nafs) 

7. Nafs-i-safiyya wa kamila (the purified and com¬ 
plete nafs) 

The nafs is considered to pass through processes which 
are termed “death and rebirth.” The first process, the White 
Death marks the initiation of the disciple, when he starts to 
reconstruct the automatic and emotional nafs, so that it will 
in turn provide an instrument for proceeding to the activa¬ 
tion of conscience, the second nafs. The adjectives “serene, 
fulfilling,” and so on, refer to the effect upon the individual, 
as well as upon the group and society in general, functions 
most marked at each stage. 



446 the sueis 

Significant phenomena of the seven stages observed dur¬ 
ing Sufi exercises include these: 

1. The individual out of personal control, believes him¬ 
self to be a coherent personality, starts to learn that he, like 
all undeveloped individuals, has a multiple and changing 

personality. &lt; n 

2. The dawn of self-awareness and "accusation, in 
which automatic thoughts are seen for what they are. 

3. The beginning of real mental integration, when the 
mind is becoming capable of operating on a higher level 
than was its previous futile custom. 

4. Serene balance, equilibrium of the individuality. 

5. Power of fulfillment, new ranges of experience not 
susceptible to description beyond approximate analogy. 

6. A new activity and function, including extra dimen¬ 
sions of the individuality. 

7. Completion of the task of reconstitution, possibility 
of teaching others, capacity for objective understanding. 

Simurgh 

The simurgh (thirty birds) is the code phrase which means 
the development of the mind through “China;” "China” 
standing, in both Persian and Arabic, for the concealed 
concept of meditation and Sufi methodology. The great At¬ 
tar clothes this teaching in an allegory: 1 

"Once, from darkness, Simurgh showed himself in China. 
One of his plumes fell to earth: a picture of it was made 
and this is still in the Chinese gallery. This is why it has 
been said, ‘Seek knowledge, even unto China. If this 
feather of Simurgh had not been seen in China, there would 
have been no acclaim in the world of hidden things. And 
this small indication of his reality is a sign of his glory. All 
souls carry the picture of the outline of that plume. And the 
matter of his description has neither beginning nor end. 
Now, People of the Path, choose this way, and start your 

journey.”

The Sufi Teacher 

Within mankind is a “treasure, 1 ” and this can be found only 
by looldng for it. The treasure is, as it were, inside a house 
(fixed thinking-patterns) which has to be broken down be¬ 
fore it can be found. In his “elephant in the dark” house, 
Rumi teaches that “if there had been a light in the house,” 
multiplicity would be seen to be in fact unity. Man sees only 
pieces of things because his mind is fixed in a pattern de¬ 
signed to see things piecemeal. 

A function of the teacher is to establish this fact to the 
disciple. Rumi has made this a subject of a poem : 1 

Destroy your house, and with the treasure hidden in it 

You will be able to build thousands of houses.

arika, Tariqa 

The Sufi wayfarer belongs to a tariqa (TaRIQa), the word 
meaning more than Path or Way: 

Tariqa = course; rule of life; line, streak; chief of a tribe, 
means; Order of dervishes. The nearest approximation to the 
sense of this word is "way” in English-the way of doing a 
thing, the way upon which a person is traveling, the way as 
an individual ("I am the Way,” in a mystical sense). 

As with other Arabic triliteral roots, the TRQ root and 
its derivatives contain elements associated with Sufism and 
the esoteric tradition: 

TaRQ = sound of a musical instrument 
TaTaRRaQ Li- = to aim at, to wish, to draw near 
to 

ATRaQ = to remain silent with downcast eyes 
TaRRaQLi- = to open the way to 
TaRaQ = to come to anyone by night

This is merely a concealed way of saying: “There is a 
potentiality in the mind of man. On one occasion it became 
activated, through a certain form of deep concentration, 
and was emulated. Without this there is no potentiality for 
development. Everyone has the faculty, in an embryonic 
form. It is something connected with eternity. Come, start 
upon the Way.” 

Spirit and Substance 

According to Sufism, what is generally referred to in reli¬ 
gious terminology as the Spirit (eZ ruK) is a substance, with 
physical characteristics, a subtle body QismA-latif'). This 
substance, as conceived, is not considered to be eternal. It 
existed before the corporealization of man (Hujwiri, Revela¬ 
tion of the Veiled ]). After physical death, the substantial 
spirit continues to exist, in one of ten forms, each corre¬ 
sponding to the formation which it has attained during 
ordinary life. There are ten stages in this sense—the first 
being that of the “sincere,” the tenth being that of the Sufi 
who has been transformed in nature by his earthly develop¬ 
ment. The ruh is at times visible.

in which resides the transmission. It is a rule of living, a 
thin line within ordinary life, sometimes maintained through 
the note of music, expressed visually by the palm tree. The 
tariqa itself opens the Path, and it is connected with medita¬ 
tion, silent thinking, as when a man sits in prayer during 
the silences of the darkness. It is both the aim and the 
method.” [Nishan-Nama (Book of Symbols) of Sufi associa¬ 
tions, by Emir Eddin Shadhili, “The Ardent”] 

Tarot 

The Tarot cards, from which European playing cards are 
derived, were introduced into the West in 1379. According 
to Feliciano Busi, a chronicler is quoted as saying: Tn the 
year 1379 was brought into Viterbo the game of cards, 
which comes from Saracinia and is called by them Naib.” 
Naib is an Arabic word meaning “deputy,” and the material 
from which the Tarot cards were copied is still extant. It 
is “deputy” or substitute material, forming an allegory of the 
teachings of a Sufi master about certain cosmic influences 
upon humanity. This is divided into four sections, called 
the turuq (four Ways), the word from which “Tarot” is 
undoubtedly derived. The Spanish word naipe (card) is 
undoubtedly from the Arabic naib. The Tarot now known 
in the West has been influenced by a Cabalistic and 
Judaizing process, designed to bring it into line with cer¬ 
tain doctrines not implicit in the original. Superficial at¬ 
tempts to link these cards with those in use in Persia or 
China have not succeeded because the essential cipher ele¬ 
ment contained in the meanings of the suits and the trumps 
is still a Sufi property. The pack, as it stands today, is only 
partially correct, because there have been transpositions of 
the significances of some of the atouts, the trumps or 
emblematic figures of the pack. This error has been caused 
by a mistranslation from Arabic of certain words, due to 
literal conversion into a different culture system. Another 
factor may be substitution of one picture for another one. 
This is not a subject upon which I may be much more ex-

plicit Temperance is incorrectly portrayed and interpreted; 
so is the fifteenth trump; the meaning of the sixteenth 
trump is a classic case of misunderstanding of a word; the 
twentieth is wrongly emphasized. Many of the attributions, 
however, are still in use among the Sufis, though in the 
West the essential associations with Sufi texts have been 
lost. 

Templars 

That the Templars were thinking in terms of the Sufi, and 
not the Solomonic, Temple in Jerusalem, and its building, 
is strongly suggested by one important fact. ‘Temple" 
churches which they erected, such as one in London, were 
modeled upon the Temple as found by the Crusaders, not 
upon any earlier building. This Temple was none other 
than the octagonal Dome of the Rock, built in the seventh 
century on a Sufi mathematical design, and restored in 913. 
The Sufi legend of the building of the Temple accords with 
the alleged Masonic version. As an example we may note 
that the ‘Solomon* of the Sufi Builders legend is not King 
Solomon but the Sufi “King" Maaruf Karkhi (died 815), 
disciple of David (Daud of Tai, died 781), and hence by 
extension considered the son of David, and referred to 
cryptically as Solomon—who was the son of David. The 
great murder commemorated by the Sufi Builders is not that 
of the person supposed by Masonic tradition to have been 
killed. The martyr of the Sufi Builders is Mansur el-Hallaj 
(858—922), juridically murdered because of the Sufi secret, 
which he spoke in a manner which could not be understood, 
and was thus dismembered as a heretic. The pillars of the 
Temple are not physical ones, but follow the Arabic cus¬ 
tom of callin g an individual (elder) a pillar. One of the 
Sufi pillars is Abulfaiz, sometimes called Abuazz. He is the 
great grandfather (third in teaching succession) of 
“David" (Maaruf Karkhi), and is none other than Thuban 
Abulfaiz Dhu'l-Nun the Egyptian, founder of the Mala- 
mati Order of Sufis, whose similarity to Freemasonry has

often been pointed out. He died in 860 A.D., and is also 
known as the King and possessor of the Egyptian secrets. 

T RANSL ITERATION 

There is no standard European or American transliteration 
of Arabic or Persian. Various attempts at reproducing the 
pronunciation by means of Latin letters have failed. When 
adaptations have been made to the Latin alphabet the result 
has been that those who already know the Arabic letter are 
able to write the letter in Arabic upon seeing the Latin 
modified letter. Those who cannot write Arabic are no bet¬ 
ter off, because the modified letter does not help them in 
pronunciation, and there is no value in their knowing any¬ 
thing about differentiation of letters if they cannot write or 
read them. There is no possibility of applying phonetic 
rules to Arabic because certain sounds are only learned by 
ear and made possible of utterance by practice. For the 
purposes of this book the approximations of spelling used 
in Latinized words are as useful to the ordinary reader as 
any artificial system. Arabs, Persians and Hindustani- 
speakers are able to know which letter to use in writing a 
word by their knowledge of the language and of its orthog- 
raphy. Orientalists of other origins have for many years 
attempted to substitute for this knowledge cumbersome 
transliterations whose main function has, in the event, been 
to cause them to rely upon the Latinization instead of their 
memories. This is opposed to the practice of the languages 
with which they have to deal. Any literate child in a coun¬ 
try using the Arabic script knows how the word abdus- 
sctmad is spelled. An equal competence should be expected 
from a foreign scholastic. Failing this, the approximation 
in ordinary Latin letters should suffice him. There is no 
middle way, although one is still being sought.

The Sufis is the first authoritative, responsible book on 
Sufism, and as such it fills a colossal gap in Western 
documentation of Eastern subjects. Following a mystical 
teaching and a way of life that has had an enormous, 
though largely unrecognized, impact on both the East 
and West for four thousand years, the Sufis believe that 
theirs is not a religion, but that it is religion. This belief 
includes conscious evolution, whereby through an effort 
of will man can originate new faculties—the faculties of 
mental telepathy and prophecy are examples—and Sufis 
therefore believe ultimately in the limitless perfectabib 
ity of man. To its followers, Sufism is the secret tradi¬ 
tion behind all religious and philosophical systems. 

Robert Graves says in his Introduction, “The natural 
Sufi may be as common in the West as in the East, and 
may come dressed as a general, a merchant, a lawyer, a 
schoolmaster, a housewife, anything. To be ‘in the world, 
but not of it,’ free from ambition, greed, intellectual 
pride, blind obedience to custom, or awe of persons 
higher in rank; that is the Sufi ideal.” 

Idries Shah, whose full name is Nawab-Zaba Sayed Idries 
Shah el-Hashimi, is Grand Sheikh of the Sufis and the 
eldest son of the Nawab (the Mohammedan equivalent 
of Maharajah) of Sardana, near Delhi in India. His fam¬ 
ily originates from the principality of Pagham in the 
Hindu Khoosh, where his ancestors have reigned since 
1221, and claims the senior descent from Mohammed 
in Islam. Idries Shah was bom at Simla in the Himalayas 
and lives in London. He has published several books 
on mystical and occult subjects.
