PREFACE 


The present work is intended to offer the readei a fair 
anthology of Mirabat’s devotional songs, using for this purpose 
with only slight departures the fifteenth edition of Achar>a 
Parashuram Chaturvedi’s well-known selection The translation 
is intended to be faithful but readable Notes are given at the 
back, filling out briefly the references in the poems to Hindu 
mythology and tradition that might not be familiar to the non- 
Hindu reader mentioning such readings adopted as differ from 
Shri Chaturvedi’s text, and discussing problematical points of 
interpretation An Introduction is prefixed, containing three 
separate essays The first deals with Mins life The second 
sketches in the use and development of the Bhakti movement 
and tries to indicate Mira’s place in it The third discusses 
briefly the literary form and spiritual content of Miia’s Padavali 
The work is addiessed to the general icadcr rathci than the 
Specialist In the Introduction and tianslation full transi’tera- 
tion of Hindi and Sanskrit words and names has not been 
applied except in quoted phrases, but the long vowels a i and 
u have been marked as such throughout Final short a has 
usually been dropped in these sections where this seemed 
appropriate according to modern spoken usage Hindi ind 
Sanskrit names and words, including the names of modern 
scholars, have in pi inciple been transliterated in full throughout 
the Notes, where a greater degree of precision seemed required 
Though this has sometimes resulted m the same word or name 
being spelt differently indifferent parts of the book it should not 
cause serious inconvenience The familiar “Mira” has been 
retained, though no doubt Mirarp is the more correct form of 
the poetess’s name It inu&t be admitted that perfect consistency 
m spelling has neither been sought nor achieved Alternations 
between “You ’ and Thou ’ in addressing the deity occur 
occasionally in the same poem, but not in the same sentence 
The author, not being himself a specialist either in the 
Rajasthani dialect or the study of mediaeval Hindi texts has 
had to rely on secondary sources both for the interpretation of 



vm 


Mira s text and foi most of the information contained m the 
introductory essays The literature on Mira is now considerable, 
especially if account be taken of the work in learned periodicals 
and in languages other than Hindi The author has not attempt- 
ed to master all this vast range of material but has tried to 
make as intelligent use as he could of a few standard authorities 
such as P Chatu'-\edi, Padmavati “Shabnain ’ and Bhuvanesh- 
vara Nath Mishra, and, for the wider background H P 
Dvivedi.Ch Vaudeville and S K De In regard to the interpreta- 
tion of the text, besides the Notes of Shri Chaturvedi, the 
tikas of Y N Sharma and T Tandan, of D S Bhat! and of 
K D Sharma were all invaluable But on especially knotty 
points particular legard was paid to the Miran Kosh of Dr 
Shashi Piabha as it seemed that the discipline of constructing 
a gtammar and word-for-word dictionary of Shn Chaturvedi’s 
text must have given her the best chance of coming up with 
the right solutions (See e g Notes 72, 90, 91, 94 116, 119, 122, 
147 166 167 170, 176, 183) Thus the work is chiefly based on 
Indian authorities And it is hoped that, if not a work of 
scholarship itself, it at least registers and brings before the 
English leader a part of the results of the work of Indian 
scholars on Mira in the past few decades 

My deepest debts are to my revered spiritual Teacher, the 
late Han Prasad Shastn, founder of Shanti Sadan, London, 
who inspired all his pupils with a love of the mystical poetry 
of mediaeval India, while at the same time demonstrating in 
his own life that the practical teachings it conveys can still be 
applied and are fully relevant to the needs of the present day 
My obligations to scholars are indicated above and acknowledg- 
ed at appropriate points throughout the Introduction and Notes 
I am obliged to the Librarian and staff of the Library of the 
School of Oriental and African Studies London University 
for the use of facilities and loan of books I am extremely 
indebted to my wife for finding time inter aha to type the 
manuscript I am very sorry that it is now too late to thank the 
late Mr Sundarlal Jam the distinguished Indological publisher 
without whose encouragement the present book would not have 
appealed

INTRODUCTION 
Mira’s Life 


The sketch of the life of Mira Bai here presented is tentative 
Like most modern accounts, it stems ultimately from the work of 
Munshi Devi Prasad entitled “Miratp Bai ka Jivan-Charitra”, 
originally published in 1905 But it incorporates modifications of 
Devi Prasad’s view, deriving from Acharya Parashuram Chatur- 
vedi, M M Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha, Hermann Goetz and 
other authorities In her work entitled “Miran Vyaktitva aur 
Kntitva”, Padmavati “Shabnam” has set out the sources from 
which Mira’s biography has been gradually built up, and has 
reviewed and critically examined the mam efforts that have been 
made to reduce them to an intelligible whole She concludes that 
Munshi Devi Prasad’s theory is radically untenable, at every 
point, and is not to be saved by mere minor modifications It 
does indeed appear from her account that Devi Prasad’s theory 
of the life of Mira is really no more than an imaginative con- 
struction, an attempt to reconcile data about Mira’s birth and 
marriage that he found in the Archives of Mewar (Mahkamah- 
e-Tavarikh, Mewar) with the few facts that are known about the 
history of the Rajputs at the time, the data available in the 
poetry that has come down in Mira’s name, and the data in the 
later hagiographical literature For his account of Mira’s death 
he was partly dependent on the word of a court-minstrel whom 
he consulted and who claimed to be in possession of the correct 
tradition, though other traditions have been shown to exist with 
equal claims Padmavati “Shabnam” certainly shows that the 
result was in many ways a weak and flimsy structure But it was 
at least based on yo/ne documentary evidence, and it seems worth 
presenting the reader with some version of Devi Prasad’s theory, 
as it IS still the “consensus” view of modern Indian scholarship 
According to the consensus view, then, Mira was born about 
1498 A D as the only daughter of Ratna Singh, a Rajput noble

of the House of Rafhor Her birth took place in a village in the 
neighbourhood of Merta, a small fortress-city some forty or 
fifty miles nbrth-east of the city of Ajmeer, itself about 220 miles 
south-west of Delhi Her mother died when she was still very 
young, and since her father was much occupied with fighting, 
she was sent to live with her grandfather Rau Duda ji in the 
palace of Merta, the city he had himself taken from the Mus- 
lims and peopled with Hindus in 1461 Here she is said to have 
been educated in company with her cousin Jaymal the future 
Rajput hero 

Mira appears to have been born m circumstances that favour- 
ed devotion to Krishna There is a tiadition that even befoie 
her mother died Mira had begged for, and ultimately received, 
an image of Krishna that had been in the possession of a holy 
man who visited her home And there is a further tradition that 
she became so attached to the image that her mother jokingly 
told her that Krishna would be her bridegroom Mira asks in 
one of her poems, “O Krishna, did You ever rightly value my 
childhood love‘^”(Poem 100) And she records (Poem 27) seeing 
herself married to the Lord in a dream (Chaturvedi, Mirarpbai 
Padavali p 19) It is likely that Mira’s devotion to Krishna was 
able to mature quickly during her time in the palace of her grand- 
father It has been thought that Mira’s life as an active devotee 
may well have set in here, with regular worship (puja) of the Lord 
embodied in an image, application of tilak to the brow, cere- 
monial waving of lights (arati) and so forth Rau Duda ji, his 
eldest son, Mira’s uncle Viram ji, and Viram ji’s son Jaymal are 
all mentioned as devotees in the later hagiographical literature 
It has been asserted on the basis of a reference to “a copper 
plate” that she was educated in the Vedas Puranas and Upani- 
shads by a Purohita called Gajadhara, who later accompanied 
her to her husband’s home at the time of her marriage 
(Bhuvanesvara Natha Misra, p 44) An education in Sanskrit as 
well as in music and dancing would not have been out of place 
in a Rajput princess of Mira’s day 

In course of time, probably not long before 1516, Rau Duda 
ji died Mira’s father Ratna Singh was still much away engag- 
ed in fighting, and her uncle Viram ji assumed responsibility 
for her education and welfare when he succeeded to his father's

kingdom Meanwhile in 1508 the great warrior Rana Sanga of 
the House of Sisodiya had succeeded his father Raymal to the 
Kingdom of Mewar, and ruled at Chittaur, the fortress that lay 
nearly 150 miles to the south of Merta, across the Aravalli 
Hills He was the acknowledged leader of the Rajputs, and 
their best hope for unity in facing the challenge of the Muslim 
powers that already hemmed them in on all sides and were 
soon to be augmented by the arrival of Babur In 1516 Rana 
Sanga sought to cement his position by marriage alliances He 
married Dhan Bai, of the Jodhpur branch of the House of 
Rathor, which ruled beyond his north-east boundaries He 
arranged with Viram Dev for the marriage of Mira with his 
own heir apparent, Prince Bhoja Raj, thereby securing the 
allegiance of the power immediately to his north And he entered 
into a marriage alliance with the power on his north-west border 
by marrying Karmavati Bal, sister of Hare Rau, King of Bund! 
It was this last alignment that boded ill for Mira For fifteen 
years later, in 1531, when Rana Sanga had been dead over 
three years, Karmavati’s son Vikramajlta (or Vikramaditya^ 
acceeded to the Kingdom of Mewar as a turbulent boy of 
fourteen, and Mira was exposed to the spite of the members of a 
rival house 

But this lay in the future In 1516 Mira was married to 
Prince Bhoja Raj, and from the fact that she was considered a 
suitable match for the heir-apparent at the most important 
capital of the Rajputs it would be concluded that her religious 
devotion had not yet led her to behave in any way that con- 
tradicted family customs The Sisodiyas, like the Rathors, were 
“Vaishnavas” or worshippers of Vishnu, m practice chiefly of 
His incarnation as Krishna Rana Sanga’s grandfather, Rana 
Kumbha, had been a noted devotee And there is a view 
(Goetz, p 11) that the “Jhali Rani”, the Rajput queen men- 
tioned in the devotional literature as a pupil of the low-caste 
Guru Raidas, was none other than Ratan Kunwari, mother of 
Rana Sanga If this is true, and if the Jhali Rani were still 
dominating the women’s side of the court at Chittaur in Mira’s 
time, it might help to account for the fact that in four surviving 
poems she speaks of Raidas as her Guru, and also for the fact 
that many of her poems are coloured by the imagery and technical

terminology of the “Sant” school to which he belonged 
But It would not entitle us to think of Raidas as Mira’s personal 
Guru For he is believed to have taught in the middle of the 
fifteenth century, well before Mira was born He is also said 
to have passed all his life in the neighbourhood of Banaras It is 
believed by some that the Jhali Rani heard of his fame and had 
the power and influence to organize a considerable expedition to 
travel to Banaras to see him Those who hold this view are 
easily able to explain Mira’s persecution They say that the 
Jhali Rani initiated l.er into the habit of receiving sadhus of the 
Sant school as visitors to enjoy their sat-sang And then Mira 
continued with the practice after the Jhali Rani died or lost 
influence, thereby exposing herself to the charge of contradicting 
family custom 

Be all that as it may, the historians tell us that Mira was 
married to Bhoja Raj in 1516, but that the marriage was child- 
less and that her husband had already died before the death of 
Rana Sanga m January 1528 In her poems, Mira speaks of her- 
self as a virgin (Poems 51 and 77 ) The year 1527 was fateful 
for Mira Rana Sanga assembled a great force of Rajputs to 
oppose the invader Babur, who possessed a smaller but well- 
drilled army, disposing of cannon The Rajputs suffered a terrible 
defeat at Khanua or Kanwaha, a village a few miles west of 
Agra, not far from Fatehpur Sikri Mira’s father Ratna Singh 
was killed, and Rana Sanga received grievous injuries It is said 
that in January 1528 this heroic man was poisoned by some of 
his ministers to prevent him organizing a counter-attack on 
Babur which would have resulted in many further casualties 
(Goetz p 18, Padmavati, p 99) 

According to an arrangement made five years earlier, the boy 
Ratna Singh succeeded to the Kingdom He was the son of Dhan 
Bm, but Queen Karmavati had a prominent place in the regency, 
(Goetz p 12 f ) Though Ratna Singh’s mother was a member 
of the Jodhpur branch of the Rathor family, there was no sym- 
pathy in court circles for the Merta branch, and an expedition 
was sent to attack Mira’s uncle, Viram Dev, ruling m Merta 
It IS plausible to maintain that this was the beginning of a period 
of isolation for Mira, which drove her to make a final and 
complete rejection of the values of the society in which she was

brought up (Chaturvedi, Padavali p 21) The poems suggest that, 
not content with receiving sadhus in the women’s quarter at the 
palace, she began to sally forth to the temple in the town, 
mingle with the holy men there and dance before the image 
(Poems 17, 19, 21) According to one of the reports found in the 
Archives of Mewar, it was already under the rulership of R.atna 
Singh that the peisecution of Mira began However, he was 
killed in a scuflBle in 1531, and this left the way open for the 
installation of Queen Karmavatfs son Vikramajita as R.ana, 
at that time a turbulent youth of fourteen or fifteen A report 
found by Munshi Devi Prasad in the Archives states that Vik- 
ramajita first locked Mira in with a guard, and then, when that 
failed of the desired effect, made an attempt to poison her, which 
also failed (cited Padmavati p 151) As the poems attributed to 
Mira refer to a Rana who locked her in (Poem 42) and tried to 
poison her (poem 36 etc ), it is presumed that the Rana in ques- 
tion was Vikramajita But the authenticity of the poems referring 
to the Rana (Poems 32-42, 50 etc ) is on several counts regarded 
as doubtful And in particular, the traditions about the miracu- 
lous intervention of the Lord to save Mira from various different 
attempts made by Vikramajita on her life, even though some of 
them are referred to in poems that have come down under Mira’s 
name, are on the whole not accepted as factual by modern 
Indian scholarship On the other hand the notion of an abortive 
attempt at poisoning is commonly accepted as probable, since it 
IS supported by documentary evidence and by the earliest hagio- 
graphical literature It is supposed by several authorities that 
Mira took refuge with her uncle Viram Dev in Merta after the 
episode of the attempted poisoning, where she remained in 
company with him and her cousin Jaymal until Viram Dev was 
expelled from his own capital by the King of Jodhpur in 1538 
Some authorities attribute to this period of Mira’s life her wor- 
ship in the Chaturbhuj temple at Merta, the ruins of which still 
stand 

Though Munshi Devi Prasad was able to claim some sort of 
documentary evidence for his account of the birth, marriage and 
persecution of Mira, the rest of her biography can only be 
guess-work As the poet Dhruvadas (first half of the Seventeenth 
Century) mentions that she visited Bnndavan, it is presumed that 



6 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


she became a v^^andering ascetic and went to Bnndavan on foot 
after the expulsion of Viram Dev from Meita m 1538 The poet 
Pnyadas (first half of the Eighteenth Century), himself a resident 
of Bnndavan, also claims that Mira visited Bnndavan, and adds 
a colourful anecdote He says that when m Bnndavan she went 
to see JivaGosvami, the famous Teacher of theChaitanya school 
The latter refused to admit her, however, on the ground that she 
was a woman Upon this Mira is said to have cast Chaitanya’s 
doctrine in his teeth and made the retort “I used to think that 
the Lord Krishna was the only man in Bnndavan and that all 
the rest of the inhabitants were gopis Now I’ve discovered that 
there’s someone else here besides Lord Krishna who thinks of 
himself as a man ” Probably the story is apocryphal Jiva 
Gosvami would have been living in Bnndavan at the time of the 
supposed visit But he would have been a youngish and still 
obscure Brahmachari, about thirteen years younger than Mira 
herself, and not the famed Guru of mature years that appears to 
be implied by the stoiy (Padmavati, p 158 P Chaturvedi, 
Madhya Kalina Prem Sadhana, p 136) 

Whatever be the truth about the visit to and residence m 
Bnndavan, there is support in Bardic Chronicles and in Mira’s 
own poems (e g Poem 202) for the belief that she went to 
Dvarak on the coast of the Kathiawar peninsular and lived there 
a considerable time, worshipping in the “Ranachor” temple The 
historian M M Gaurishankar Ojha (cited Padmavati, p 158) 
makes Mira go direct to Dvarak on leaving Merta, without any 
intermediate visit to Bnndavan 

In regard to the date and place ot Mira’s death we are at a 
loss Pnyadas says that in the course of time evils fell on the 
city of Chittaur (it was occupied by the Muslims more than 
once and was finally to be destroyed in 1 568) and that the King 
of Mewar and Mira’s other family members began to think its 
decline was due to the persecution of a great devotee The King 
therefore sent a deputation of court priests to beg Mira to return 
Uncertain what to do, Mira retired to the temple of Ranachor 
to pray, and her body melted physically into the image of the 
deity In the absence of reliable information about Mira’s death, 
the legend provides a fitting image to remember her by Munshi 
Devi Prasad dated the event 1546 on the word ol the court-

minstrel mentioned earlier, which enabled him to pinpoint the 
King m question as Udaisingh But the legend has not, on the 
whole, been accepted by modem Indian scholars as based on 
fact Other estimates of the date of Mira’s death have been given, 
following stray hints, most of them later than 1546 But there 
IS no settled conclusion 

As already mentioned, Padmavati “Shabnam” has reviewed 
the existing literature on the life of Mirabai, and the present 
sketch is certainly indebted to that part of her labours She 
concludes, however, that Munsht Devi Prasad’s theory that 
Mira was the grand-daughter of Rau Duda ji and the wife of 
Bhoja Raj is altogether untenable It must be admitted that the 
“consensus” view (originating from the respected Munshi) is 
not much more than a guess m regard to all the events in Mira’s 
life following the attempted poisoning But on Mira’s parentage, 
her mairiage, the persecution instituted be Ratna Singh, and the 
locking-up and attempted poisoning carried out by Vikramajita 
the Munshi was able to cite documents he had found in the 
Archives of Mewar Padmavati “Shabnam” finds them mutually 
contradictory and valueless as evidence (Padmavati, p 45) But 
in some of the cases she instances, it could perhaps be argued 
that the documents corroborate one another in substance, while 
only contradicting one another on points of comparative 
detail 

However, this is not the place to attempt to assess in detail 
what can of or cannot be salvaged for the “consensus” view, 
nor IS the present writer equipped for such a task It will be 
enough to suggest that it may be analyzable into stronger and 
weaker parts, if some parts can still be shown to have document- 
ary support The view to which Padmavati ‘ Shabnam” herself 
inclines is that Mira was the daughter (not the grand-daughter) 
of Duda ji and the wife of Rana Raymal, who was the 
father of Rana Sanga, and who reigned at Chittaur 1473-1508 
There seems to be little positive evidence in favour of this 
identification But it obviates the diflBiculties involved in picturing 
Mira as a widow, when she frequently refers in her poems to 
her jewelry, and as being persecuted by a young Rana of 15 
More significantly, it brings Mira back within the possible time- 
span of the life of Raidas This raises tne question of the 



8 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


possibility of accepting the four statements in the poems that 
Raidas was Mira’s Guru as the literal truth It is claimed locally 
that a strange stone figure opposite the so-called MIrabai temple 
in Chittaur represents the body and the insignia of Raidas 
(Chaturvedi, Madhya-Kalina Prem Sadhana, p 137 ) But there 
are difficulties in the way of accepting that Raidas could have 
been Mira’s Guru, such as the absence of traditions in the Sant 
school for connecting Raidas with Mira and the presence of 
traditions that he never left the neighbourhood of Banaras 
(Bhuvanesvara Natha Mi^ra, p 59) And while four of the poems 
attributed to Mira connect her with Raidas, the hagiographical 
literature does not Moreover, the reference to Dhanna m 
Poem 139 of her poems suggests a figure of the fairly distant 
past whose memory has already become encrusted with miracles, 
while in one of his own poems Dhanna refers to Raidas as a 
predecessor (Macauliffe, p 109) Even if this be regarded as 
inconclusive on the ground that Poem 139 might be an inter- 
polation, it remains true that there is no documentary evidence in 
favour of the view that Mira was a queen of Raymal, and what 
documentary evidence exists is against it, in as much as 
Padmavati herself refers to a list of Raymal’s twelve queens in 
which Mira is not included (Padmavati, p 135) And if the 
pioems of Mira mentioning a wicked and atheistic Rana have 
any historical validity at all, they fit in better with Vikramajita, 
who, though only a boy, is known to have been of a vicious 
temperament, whereas Raymal is credited with Vaishnava piety 
and the construction of a temple to Damodara at Kumbhalmer 
fortress in 1498 (Bhuvanesvara Natha Mi^ra, p 40) 

These considerations in partial defence of the “consensus” 
that Mira was married to Bhoja Raj occurred to the mind and 
It seemed right to set them down But as a non-specialist the 
present writer is in no position to detract from Padmavati 
Shabnam’s contribution If new light on the life of Mu a and 
on problems about the authenticity of the poems come down 
under her name is to come, it can only do so through serious 
first-hand investigations into the textual sources like hers It it 
should eventually turn out that the personal connection between 
Mira and Raidas was established, or even between Mira and 
some member of his school, it would necessitate some rethinking 



Introduction

about what poems should be admitted into the standard text 
of Mira’s Padavali For instance, some poems written in the 
technical terminology of the Sant school, excluded by Ach^rya 
Chaturvedi, might have to be included after all For the moment, 
however, the question appears to be in the balance It does not 
seem that Padmavati “Shabnam” has decisively refuted the 
consensus view 


Mira and the Bhakti Movement 

Whatever view be taken of the chronology of Mira’s life, she 
must have lived in the midst of a great devotional renaissance 
If the “consensus” view of her life be approximately correct, 
Raidas, Kabir, Vidyapati, Chandidas and Narsi Mehta were 
among her immediate forerunners Surdas, Guru Nanak, and 
the early poets of the schools of Vallabha and Chaitanya were 
her contemporaries Tulsidas, surpassing even Surdas as the 
greatest devotional poet in Hindi, was probably born towards 
the latter end of her life-span In the present essay it is proposed 
to sketch in the history of the rise ot devotion (bhakti) in India 
and to try to say something about Mira’s place amidst the 
various schools 

The word “Bhakti” comes from the root “bhaj” meaning “to 
share” The basic idea is that God (termed “Bhagavan”, also 
from the root “bhaj”) allows His devotees (His “Bhaktas”) to 
share m His own nature and His own Consciousness, if they 
offer themselves to Him in sincere love Thus expressed, the 
term Bhakti implies a distinction between the Lord and His 
devotee But amongst the Bhakti schools who offered their 
devotion to Vishnu, with which the present essay is chiefly 
concerned, only the “Brahma-Sampradaya” of Shn Madhva 
(1199-1278) held to the radical separateness of the world and 
the individual souls from God The mam tendency in Hinduism 
IS to stress the unity behind the apparent diversity of the objects 
of the time-space world, and in general the diffeient cults do 
just this, in varying ways and with varying degrees of intensity 

The dozen or so “classical” Upanishads commented on by 
Bhagavatpada Shankara (circa 700 ad) are the highest 
expression of the “Sanatana Dharma” or “Eternal Wisdom” of 



10 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


orthodox Hinduism They weie probably composed between the 
eighth and third centuries B c , the earlier ones being compila- 
tions, the later ones more like unitary compositions b> a single 
author They are regarded as being effective in the spiritual 
life of a devotee only after their texts have been synthesized into 
a harmonious whole and intei preted according to a aefinite 
tradition (sampradaya), possessing a doctrine that is logically 
defensible on its own chosen assumptions, the truth ot which 
has been verified by the personal experience of the Teachers 
who convey it The Upanishadic teachings thus synthesized are 
known as the Vedanta, and their exponents as Vedantins If we 
set aside the radically dualistic doctrine of Madhva as excep- 
tional and ignoie the Shaiva interpretations ot the Vedanta as 
not relevant to our present enquiry, the chief remaining schools 
of Vedanta may be oivided into two classes, both of which 
affirm that the leai is “non-dual” or “one-without-a-second” 
To the first class belongs the school of Shankara, maintaining 
“pure non-duality” (Kevala-advaita) To the second belong the 
schools of Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Chaitanya This 
second group of Acharyas ranges in date from the eleventh to 
the sixteenth century Like the school of Shankara, its members 
also maintain the “non-duality” of the real, but unlike Shankara 
they credit it \n various ways with real internal distinctions 
for Shankara, the world and its distinctions are illusory as is 
the distinction between the individual soul and the supreme 
non-dual Self in which, as puie undifferentiated Consciousness, 
the whole illusion rests For him, devotion to God conceived 
in limited or personal form is a most wholesome and purifying 
practice But it is only a prehminaiy Final liberation fiom cmI 
only comes through the knowledge that one is identical 
with the supreme Self that supports all as infinite undifierentiatcd 
Consciousness This knowledge or awakening comes primarily 
from hearing the supreme Upan,shadic texts from a competent 
Teacher who himself has direct intuitional awareness of the truth 
ot their content Even then, the texts can normally only do their 
work after the student has prepared himself to understand them 
by a disciplined life, (yama and niyama), and by reflection 
(inanana) and prolonged meditation on the Upanishadic texts 
under the guidance of the Guru 



Introduction 


11 


In the other Vedanta schools mentioned, it is generally speak- 
ing knowledge that is the preliminary and devotion the crowning 
part of the discipline They regard the world and its objects and 
also the multiplicity of souls as distinct emanations from the 
Lord But the Lord is present in all. He inhabits His creation, 
and He animates all living beings with a “ray” of His conscious- 
ness and is, in a specially intimate sense, “present in their heaits” 
The goal of the spiritual life is for the individual to disentangle 
himself from attachment to and identification with the body and 
to become aware that in his essential nature he is homogeneous 
with the supreme Spirit (purusottama), a ray of the latter and 
able to enjoy a love-relation with Him, conceived in personal 
form The Lord might rescue such a soul from the ocean of 
transmigratory life and transport him to His heaven on the death 
of the physical body, there for him to remain in perpetual 
adoration and felicity 

The Vedanta, however, is not based exclusively on the Upani- 
shads It has three starting-points (prasthana) in the classical 
Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita The 
Brahma Sutras are the authoritative digest of the Upanishads^ 
and the Acharyas developed their systems by writing comment- 
aries on them, each interpreting their terse formulae according 
to his own peculiar logic The collection of Sutras as we have 
them piobably grew into existence gradually during (and befoie) 
the early centuries of the Christian era They refer to the Bhaga- 
vad Gita as an authoritative text, the composition of the latter 
being often dated vaguely to about 200 B c , since it quotes the 
later classical Upanishads, some of which appear to have been 
composed after Buddhism had spread 

The Vedanta is really a synthesis between the Vedic religion, 
developed by the Aryan invaders, and other forms of Indian 
worship with roots probably stretching back before Aryan times 
(Cp De, pp 162-176) The later Upanishadic period saw a 
challenge to the old Vedic religion and to the authority of the 
Brahmins who preserved it On the one hand, teachers like 
Gautama Buddha and Mahavira were attacking its sacrificial 
ritual as cruel and its caste system as unhumanitarian, and were 
giving ethical and spiritual instructions of a high order in the 
vernacular On the other hand the old Vedic religion was itself

falling into decay What had begun as outdoor worship of the 
personified forces of nature later soared to the heights of true 
mysticism when the sages “pondered in their hearts, searching 
for the link between non-being and being” But it finally degener- 
ated into a soulless formalism, in which the meticulous perform- 
ance of the complicated ritual counted ever for more and more 
and the deity for less and less The Upamshads, it is true, 
contained texts unfolding the highest wisdom attainable by man 
But in the form m which they were preserved, these texts were 
addressed only to those members of the higher castes who had 
leisure in youth to learn the Vedic texts by heart, and to that 
small percentage of these which was willing to abandon house- 
hold life and take to the forests 

Oversimplifying somewhat, we may say that the response of 
Brahminical orthodoxy to the challenge of the “heretical” reli- 
gions was to allow the old Vedic religion to fall into comparative 
relapse and to adopt and refashion themes of popular worship 
We see various stages of this process registered in the Epics 
(Mahabharata including the Gita and the Ramayana), in the 
earlier Puranas, and later in the Tantras Included in it was the 
adoption of the ancient Bhagavata religion, which gradually 
assumed a levised form in which Bhagavan was identified with 
Vasudeva and Krishna, and both with the old Vedic deity 
Vishnu 

Meister Eckhart has said that it is the birth of Christ in the 
heart of the devotee now that matters, not so much His birth in 
Bethlehem many years ago The “historical Krishna” revealed 
(or rather not revealed) by modern scholarship is no more the 
Krishna who levealed Himself in the hearts of the saints of 
mediaeval India than the “historical Jesus" of modern Biblical 
scholarship is the figure that lit the hearts of St Francis and St 
Bonaventura The historical Krishna is in fact even more elusive 
than the historical Jesus But Acharya Chaturvedi thinks we 
have just about enough evidence to think of him as a great 
warrior and Teacher, a Kshatria of the Yadava tribe, who receiv- 
ed spiiitual instruction at the hands of Ghora Angirasa (Chan- 
dogya Upanishad III vii 6), who slew King Kansa at Mathura, 
who supported the Pandavas in the Mahabharata war, and who 
was eventually deified by the later generations of those who

followed his teaching (Chaturvedi, Vaishnava Dharma, p 32) 
Those who take this view commonly maintain that the Bhagavad 
Gita preserves the essence of Krishna’s teaching Admittedly its 
teachings do not agree very well with what is known of those of 
Ghora Angirasa (De, p 32 ff) But at any rate it was taken by 
the Bhaktas of mediaeval India as the personal word of Krishna 
And it marks an important phase in the restatement of the 
Upanishadic wisdom in a more popular form and with increased 
stress on the element of devotion 

Indeed, the Gita can be viewed partly as an attempt to 
popularize the Upanishadic teachings and bring them to a wider 
circle The author tries to preserve all that was great and pro- 
found in the earlier teaching and at the same time to make it 
available to all men of good will, living and working in the world 
The Upanishadic doctrine that liberation arises through attain- 
ing an intuitive knowledge of one’s identity with the world- 
ground (brahma-nirvana) is allowed to stand But the peculiar 
path of renunciation of worldly life and solitary meditation on 
abstract principles which leads to it is declared “hard” The 
prime purpose of the Gita is to teach an easier path to liberation 
This easier path has two phases The first consists in self-pun- 
fication through disinterested action (karma-yoga) The second 
consists m devotion to the Absolute conceived in personal form 
(bhakti-yoga) The devotion called for in the Gita seems to be 
something a great deal stronger than the mere meditation on the 
Absolute associated with this or that finite form enjoined in the 
sections of the Upanishads concerned with worship (upasana- 
kanda) It means living m the faith and conviction that one 
participates m the nature of God, in such a way that one concen- 
trates all one’s powers on God as the great whole of which one 
is a severed fragment, desiring above all to be re-united with the 
whole The devotee understands that he cannot know God in 
His tiue form But He conceives Him under forms that inspire 
deep awe and reverence and he expresses his love foi Him in 
service of His creatures The Gita does not specify whether the 
sincere devotee is dissolved in God at death or whether he retains 
his individuality Though it speaks of the soul as a “ray ’ of 
God, it does not mention the delights of a sojourn in Vishnu’s 
heaven So Shankara’s view that complete dissolution is meant is 



14 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


at least defensible It is a lemarkable point that Mira looks 
forwaid to complete dissolution in God at death (Poem 46, last 
2 lines), wheieas the great Vaishnava Teachers of the Middle 
Ages, such as Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka, Vallabha and 
Chaitanya speak, m geneial, of the released soul retaining its 
individuality after death and enjoying felicity m one form or 
anothei m the adoration of the Lord 

The texts conveying Bhakti we have considered so far were all 
composed m Sanskrit and therefore, in general, immediately 
available only to those of the top three castes who had the leisure 
to learn that beautiful but complicated language Nevertheless, 
It was beginning to be affirmed more frequently that all men had 
access to salvation thiough the texts of the Epics and Puranas, 
even if the heai mg of the Veda and XJpanishads was confined to the 
“twice-born”, the three higher castes These castes did in fact 
manage to preserve their position and dominance and keep the 
tradition of memorizing the Vedic and Upanishadic texts alive 
But in the face of the criticism of Materialists, Buddhists and 
Jamas and of the apathy of many of their own members, who found 
little appeal either m cold Vedic ritualism or in abstruse Upanishadic 
speculation, adaptations had to be made The Brahmins absorbed 
into their own system many originally independent conceptions 
of the deity by identifying them with the deity Vishnu from their 
own pantheon From his dignified but comparatively subordinate 
role as sun-deity in the Rig Veda, Vishnu was elevated to the 
state of supreme Spirit and identified with Bhagavan, Vasudeva, 
Krishna, Narayana and other less widely known divine figures, 
so that the cults and beliefs associated with these deities were 
mingled together and applied to Him Similarly, the worship of 
the comparatively minor Rig Vedic deity Rudra was altered and 
expanded to incorporate new myths and new practices under the 
name of Shaivism or Shiva-worship Borrowing and adaptation 
from the practices and beliefs originally belonging to the non- 
Aryan indigenous population played a large part in all this pro- 
cess Indeed, the shock of the contact between the Aryan inva- 
ders and the pre-Aryan inhabitants had already been a factor in 
producing the creative tension that led to the lofty teaching of 
the classical Upanishads not to speak of the various phases of the 
Buddhist and Jama religions But with the advent of Vaishnavism

and Shaivism, the non Aryan element came even more to 
the fore By the time of the Tantnka and Shakta movements, 
beginning in the latter half of the first millennium a d , when the 
sectarian texts were addressing themselves to men and women of 
all castes and openly declaring that they had supplanted the Veda 
as the vehicle of salvation for men in the Iron Age (Kali Yuga), 
It was no longer a question of the old Aryan religion absorbing 
non-Aryan elements but rather of its being itself absorbed by 
that age-old “Mother India” already evident in the ancient 
Mahenjo Daro civilization 

As the period of the Vedic revelation proper (Shruti) gave 
way to that of the derivative literature (Smriti), the latter being 
at its height between 200 b c and 500 ad a whole new myth- 
ology was developed in the Law Books (Dharma Shastra, the 
Smriti par excellence), the Epics and the earlier Pi ranas After 
a comparatively weak challenge from the old Vedic gods 
Brahma, Agni and Surya, the two Vedic deities Shiva (formerly 
Rudra) and Vishnu came to dominate Their cult was eman- 
cipated from Its setting in the old Vedic texts, and drew fresh 
nourishment and new vigour from association with popular 
local cults It was in considerable part to this process that 
Vishnu owed His ‘ Thousand Names” The new religion had 
an exterior form consisting of image-worship (puja) m temples, 
quite unknown in the Vedic texts, and it had an interior or 
mental form, in which the deity was approached through newly 
devised methods of meditation as resident within the body of 
the worshipper Repetition with a rosary of short formulae 
embodying the name of the deity worshipped (mantra-japa) is to 
be accounted among the new techniques The earliest references 
connect it with the worship of Shiva, but the formula “Om 
namo Vasudevaya’ is already found referred to Vishnu in the 
fifth century literature, which is a sign that the actual practice 
of repeating it must have begun considerably earlier The other 
ancient deities of the Vedic pantheon lost status in comparison 
to Shiva and Vishnu, as is well symbolized in the early chapters 
of the Tenth Book of the Bhagavata Purana, where the child 
Krishna humiliates Brahma and Indra Mira refers to the 
humiliation of Indra in the opening poem of the Padavali 

The Vishnu of the Mahabharata and early Puranas is included

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


in Mira’s conception of the Lord (Prabhu), bat is not the 
only or the foremost element According to the earlier concep- 
tion He “manifested” (pradurbhava) again and again in different 
forms to save His devotees from the attacks of the evil forces 
and to preserve the spiritual law when it was in danger of fall- 
ing into neglect According to a rather later conception 
Vishnu undertook “descents” (avatara) not only to relieve the 
immediate sufferings of His devotees and to kill demons plaguin 
the earth but also to leave behind amongst His devotees 
a memory of His deeds (lila), meditation on which would 
serve to purify the whole world of its sms (cp Adhyatma 
Ramayana, opening verse, Kirtim papa-haram vidhaya 
jagatam) 

During the course of the first millennium ad a new form 
of the worship of Krishna gradually developed, not found in 
the older texts and mysterious in origin Krishna the warrior 
and counsellor began to fall more and more into the background, 
and gradually the chief emphasis came to be placed on worship 
of Krishna as a boy of wondrous beauty, growing up from 
childhood to adolescence in the villages of cowherds on the 
banks of the Jumna a few miles upstream from Mathura The 
child Krishna is hardly known to the Mahabharata, but His 
deeds are recorded in the Vishnu Parana and Harivansha (fifth 
century a d ) Parallel with this development, though not 
intimately connected with it, temple-worship was developed 
both in Vaishnava and Shaiva circles Shankara Bhagavatpada, 
who effected the earliest surviving synthesis between the doctri- 
nes of the Veda, the Epic and the Puranas, speaks with marked 
sympathy of the devotional practices of the worshippers of 
Vishnu, even though he criticizes their theory of “Vyuhas” in 
so far as he found it unreconcilable with Upanishadic non- 
dualism (Brahma Sutra Commentary II ii 42) He enumer- 
ates them as visiting the temple (abhigamana), concentrating 
on Vasudeva (Krishna) in thought, word and deed, offering of 
articles before the image, active worship of the image in the 
form of bathing it, anointing it and decorating it with flowers, 
repetition of the eight-syllabled mantram (Om namo 
Narayanaya), and meditative practices (yoga-dhya«ia) (cp H P 
Dvivedi, Madhya-kalina Dharma Sadhana, p 124)

During this time, if not before it, the creative impulse in 
devotion to Krishna passed to South India The twelve devotees 
of Tamil Nad known as the Alvars, who apparently lived in 
second half of the first millennium a d , composed devotional 
hymns in the vernacular, celebrating Vishnu both in His form 
as the child Krishna and also according to the earlier tradi- 
tional conceptions They paid little attention to caste-distinc- 
tions and included in their number a king, a woman and several 
outcastes The work of the Alvars was valued and preserved by 
the “Acharyas” of the Sri Sampradaya, high-caste representa- 
tives of the Vedanta tradition, mostly monks, but more intimate- 
ly associated with the temple-worship of lay folk than Shankara 
had been They wrote commentaries in Sanskrit and produced 
a new synthesis of the Vedanta (Upanishads) and the deriva- 
tive literature (Epics, Gita and Puranas) They claimed to go 
back behind Shankara to earlier commentators on the Brhama 
Sutras whose work is now lost But in fact the old Upamshadic 
teachings were partly modified in the light of texts from the 
Gita, Mahabharata and Vishnu Purana so as to accommodate 
devotion to the Lord conceived in personal form as the supreme 
discipline The greatest figure in this movement was Ramanuja 
(second half of the eleventh century) Though a representative 
of orthodox Brahmanism, he partly relaxed the tradition accord- 
ing to which only the three higher castes had access to the 
Vedantic truth 

Ramanuja has been thought of as the link between Bhakti as 
a popular movement in the South and Bhakti as a popular 
movement in the North For on the one hand he called the 
Tamil works of the “outcaste” Sathakopa Acharya the “Veda 
of the Vaishnavas” and helped to preside over their preser- 
vation And on the other hand it is said to have been an Acharya 
of his line residing in Banaras, Raghavananda, who initiated 
Ramananda, who is in turn said to have been the father of the 
Sant tradition of Northern India, of whom more must be said 
below Perhaps too much should not be made of this connection. 
For none of the Sants actually mention Ramananda as their 
Guru (Chaturvedi, Sant Parampara p 224f ) And Ramananda 
IS in any case said to have broken with Raghavananda because 
the latter still adhered too much to caste distinctions Perhaps 



18 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Ramananda’s service to the Bhakti movement was to create the 
climate m which the Sants could give out their message He is 
said to have inspired people to carry the message that all who 
worshipped Han formed one great brotherhood quite indepen- 
dent of caste and to have set the example of instructing un- 
lettered folk 111 the vernacular about remembrance of the 
Name of God 

But South India produced one other phenomenon in the latter 
half of the first millennium a d that was an even more potent 
aid to the development of Krishna Bhakti than the Sn Sam- 
pradaya of Ramanuja, and that was the composition of the 
Bhagavata Purana (circa 800 ad) This magnificent work 
appears to have remained for several centuries after its composi- 
tion in comparative obscurity Ramanuja, for instance, does 
not mention it But Nimbarka, Vallabha and Chaitanya 
regarded it as of at least equal authority with the Veda It gives 
in fact what might be called the standard or classical account 
both of the sports of Krishna as child and adolescent and of 
the devotional tenets of the Vaishnava faith 

Mira touches so lightly on the scenes of Krishna’s child- 
hood depicted in the Bhagavata that it hardly seems neces- 
sary to give any connected summary of the narrative here 
The reader will find in Mira’s Padavali brief references to 
the childish sports of the Lord in the Brai, which must derive 
oirectly or indirectly from the Bhagavata Such are the expul- 
sion of the snake Kaliya from Braj, (Poem 1 and 168) the stealing 
of the clothes of the cowherd-maidens when they were bathing 
(applied by Mira to herself, conceived as a Gopi), (Poem 169) 
the morning ritual of setting off to pasture the cows, (165) and 
holding the Govardhana Mountain aloft to protect the inhabi- 
tants of Braj from the fury of Indra (1) In general, how- 
ever, Mira does not undertake to re-depict the sports of the 
Lord objectively (Cp Bhuvaneshvara Natha Mishra, p 196) 
Rather, she records episodes in her own private love-relation- 
ship with the Lord Like the Alvar poetess Goda, she believed 
herself to have been a Gopi in a former birth 

In one or two poems Mira refers to the Gopi (cowherd- 
maiden) Radha Building upon hints in the Bhagavata and 
other Vaishnava literature (and drawing also on local folk-

lone traditions) great poets of the order of Jai Dev and 
Chandidas in Bengal and Vidyapati in Darbhanga had developed 
the theme of a personal love-affair between Krishna and one 
of the Gopis, Radha H P Dvivedi has drawn attention to the 
idealism latent in the character of Radha as depicted by these 
poets (Madhya-Kalina Dharma Sadhana, p 159, 183, 194) But 
even allowing for such elements and for the fact that some of 
this poetry may be intended as an illustration of how ordinary 
human sex-love can be transfigured and raised to the plane of the 
love of God according to the tenets of the Vaishnava Sahajiya 
sect, (Chaturvedi, Prem Sadhana p 85 f ) it does seem to imply 
a markedly different conception of devotion from that of Mira 
So far as the writer’s very limited acquaintance with it goes, it 
seems to be extraordinarily brilliant poetry composed by con- 
noisseurs for connoisseurs Jai Dev addresses his “Padavali” (i e 
the Gita-Govinda) to the mind which has a taste for remembrance 
of Han and an enthusiasm for the fine arts (vilasa-kala) And it 
IS a commonly held view that whereas the erotic element in the 
Bhagavata Purana, though present, is a mere phase of the devo- 
tional element, in parts of the poetry now under discussion the 
erotic element tends to get the upper hand Vrajeshvara Varma 
claims (in Dhirendra Varma, p 353) that Vidyapati’s Padavali 
IS pure secular love poetry, and that about half the poems do 
not concern Radha and Krishna at all 

In any case there is nothing highly-wrought about Mira’s 
style, and no erotic element in her poetry whatever (Bhuvanesh- 
vara Natha Mishra, p 195) Mastery of the elements of versi- 
fication and music are taken for granted But Mira was primarily 
a devotee, and if she was a poetess or a musician or anything 
else whatever, that was secondary (Chaturvedi, Madhya-kalina 
Prem Sadhana, p 130) She borrows many of the traditional 
cliches of Indian love-poetry that are also found in Vidyapati 
and Chandidas But with her they are instruments used to 
express a deep and personally felt emotion She may use the 
marriage-bed as a symbol of mystical umon with God, in the 
manner of the Sant poets, or as a symbol of the devotee’s 
readiness to give the Lord all that is in his power But in 
Mira’s poetry there is no tendency to luxuriate in devotional 
feelings tinged with eroticism So she is not faced with the 



20 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


danger that besets the poet who evokes images of the Lord in 
the context of burning sexual passion, the danger of making the 
deity less than a person, of reducing Him to a kind of object, 
a source of exquisite emotions that is available to the devotee 
and, so to speak, “stands at his disposal” (Hacker, p 51) 
Neither is Mira in any way influenced by the tendency found in 
some of the later Puranas to elevate Radha into the Cosmic 
Power of the Lord or even to worship her in her own right as 
the Divine Mother Her Radha is simply an especially charm- 
ing fellow-devotee, who grieves when her Lord is “absent” and 
does all she can to please Him when He is present, as a good 
devotee should 

The present writer cannot discuss in any detail the resemb- 
lances and differences between Mira and the greatest of her 
contemporaries amongst Krishna-poets, Sur Das, for lack of a 
proper first-hand acquaintance with the sources Clearly she 
was not Sur Das’s equal technically as a poet In spirit they 
seem to stand close Both were true devotees of the Lord Sur 
painted scenes and incidents from the life of Krishna as child 
and youth Mira expressed a more personal associationship 
with the Lord One might have expected that, as a pupil of 
Vallabha, Sur would have looked forward to an eternity m 
Krishna’s heaven (Go-loka^ after death, whereas Mira begged 
for dissolution in the Lord But it appears that the difference 
on this score was not great Verses occur in Sur’s poetry in 
which he asks to be transported to Vaikuntha (Go-Ioka) and 
also others where he asks for “dissolution” (nirvana) But 
these requests pale in number and significance before his chief 
request, which was “Grant me devotion ” (Brajveshvara Varma 
p 209) Both he and Mira were concerned with the here and 
now rather than with the hereafter And this is the true attitude 
of the mystic

It has often been remarked that the occasional references to 
Mira in the later devotional literature of Vallabha’s school 
suggest that she was regarded as an outsider, an irregular 
devotee who did not belong to any recognized tradition 
(sampradaya) In Acharya Chaturvedi’s revised (fifteenth) 
edition of the Poems there is only one reference to a Guru, 
(Poem 111) and the particular technical term used (Sat-Guru) 
suggests association with the Sant school Shri Chaturvedi has 
expressed doubts about the authenticity of this reference, and 
even if it should prove authentic it need not necessarily point to 
a single Guru of the Sant school The Sants speak so often of 
the Sat-Guru and so seldom of any particular Guru that modern 
scholars have come to wonder whether the term may not be 
applicable to any Guru from association (Satsang) with whom 
one has learned spiritually valuable lessons Often the Sat-Guru 
IS the inner “voice” (jnana, viveka, sabda) heard by the poet 
in the interior depths of his own soul (Chaturvedi, Sant-Param- 
para p 162 f Vaudeville, p 116 f, p 137) In Poem 139 of 
Mira’s Padavali, which, again, may or may not be authentic, 
there are references to miraculous interventions by the Lord to 
save His devotees, who include the Sants Kabir, Nama Deva 
and Dhanna But even if it should turn out that the lines or 
poems referring directly to a Sat-Guru or to the Sants by name 
have to be rejected, there are still plenty of lines in the Poems 
that echo the Sants’ teaching 

It IS difficult to characterize the Teachers of the Sant school 
briefly, and they each had their own marked individuality They 
were unlettered Teachers of low caste, who had been giving out 
ethical and spiritual instruction on the plains of Northern India 
for some generations before Mira’s birth The style of their 
songs and many of the technical terms they used were inherited 
from earlier Teachers of Northern India called Siddhas and 
Nathas The Siddhas in their turn inherited much from the 
Buddhist Tantrika Teachers who had survived in Bengal, Assam 
and Tibet when the Muslims had overrun most of the Ganges 
plain 

The basic idea behind the Tantrika teaching and practice Itere- 
in question is that the whole cosmos is shot througfi with divine 
powers These powers are also present in the body of the adept

and can be awakened by suitable ritual oi physiological practices 
In some of the poems attributed to him the Sant Kabjr speaks 
language which seems to point to experiences gained through 
arousing the “kundalini” through the various yogic “chakras” 
till It reaches the “thousand-petalled lotus” in the top of the 
head And there seem to be reference® to yogic practices of 
this kind m poems that are linked with Mira’s name but 
which are not allowed admittance into Acharya Chaturvedi’s 
collection in its present form Equally, there are poems attri- 
buted to each author denouncing such practices, especially if not 
accompained by the one practice, that really matters, continuous 
remembrance of the holy Name (Cp Vaudeville, p 143) 

Even in the present (fifteenth) edition of Shn Chaturvedi s 
version of Mira’s Padavali, however^ which excludes some well- 
known poems which refer to Raidas as a personal Guru and 
others which refer to yogic chakras, there remain plenty of 
echoes of Sant teaching, which may be attributed to what she 
heard when mingling with the Sadhus But her lesort to temples 
for dancing and singing (Poem 31 etc) and her practice of 
Puja of images (Poem 145) set her somewhat apart from the 
classical Sant tradition One can hardiv imagine Kabir or Rai- 
das dancing or performing PQja in a temple Mira uses the 
word “Rama” to mean God in general, which is a typical practice 

of the Sants But whereas they tended to speak of their God 
either as “featureless” (nirguna) or as “not even featureless ’ (i e 
totally indescribable), and seem to have used the word “Rama” 
mainly because it was in vogue, Mira definitely connects the 
name Rama with the visible image of her beloved Shy ima {Shri 
Krishna) (See Poem 16) In the opening line of Poem 187 she 
uses the word Rama to refer to Krishna as He greets His former 
play-fellow Sudama It must be remembered that Kabir and the 
Sams of his time generally were more preoccupied than Mha 
was with reconciling Hindu-Muslim dilfercnces They therefore 
attacked many things which they considered tended to divide 
but which Mira held dear, such as worship of images, obser- 
vance of special fasts (Cp Poem 145) and above all, the doctrine 
that Vishnu “descended” to earth This last was central to Mira s 
faith, as she believed herself to have been with Krishna in a 
pievious life 



Introduction

Possibly it would be right to say that Mira’s deepest spiritual 
affinities he not with the brilliant and sophisticated court-poets 
of the North East (Jai Dev etc ), nor with the brilliant temple- 
poets of Braj (school of Vallabha) nor with the “Nirguna-Vada” 
Sants of Uttara Pradesh, Rajasthan and the Punjab, but rather 
with the Krishna-devotees of Maharashtra and Gujarat It can- 
not be said that the mysticism of the saints of Maharashtra 
recalls the intimately personal relationship of Mira with her 
“Gindhara Nagara” But they are similar to Mira in their 
acceptance of temple-worship and devotion to Krishna personally 
conceived, along with emphasis on the remembrance of the Name 
and the view that devotion has a supreme phase that eventually 
culminates in dissolution in the deity 

For example, Jnaneshvara (1271-1293) composed in old 
Marathi a famous verse commentary on the Gita which has 
more than once been translated into English One of the remark- 
able points about this work is that, though its predominant tone 
IS devotional, some passages (as in the Shrimad Bhagavata) 
strike the note of Shankara’s pure non-dualism (Cp Gonda, 
p 218 f ) Thus in the exordium to the Sixteenth Chapter paying 
honour to his Guru Nivrittinatha as the sun of knowledge, he 
says “When the sun reaches the zenith of Self-knowledge and 
shines down ‘in the noon-tide of Realization of the Absolute 
(brahma-bhava)’, its shadow, the false self ot illusion (the 
individual ego of ordinary unregenerate experience), retires and 
becomes hidden beneath it, and then the ‘night of Maya’ no 
longer exists, the world disappears and the sleep of wrong 
knowledge no longer has any foundation ” Mira does not 
hark back to the terminology of the Upanishads in this way 
But she affirms the fundamental identity of the individual soul 
with the Lord, and begs to be dissolved in Him “Thou and I 
are one, like the sun and its heat” (Poem 1 14) and “Let my 
light dissolve m Your light before You depart ”(46) 

With the name of Jnaneshvara is linked that of Nam Dev, 
formerly taken to have been his contemporary, but now 
considered later by a centuiy He is probably to be identified 
with the poet of the same name who composed works in Hindi 
which are included in the Guru Granth Sahib (Chaturvedi, 
Sant-Parampara p 105) Nam Dev also speaks language that

comes close to the pure non-dualism of Shankara The devotee 
(jana) and God (Thakur) become one, like water poured into 
water (Compare, once again, the last lines of Mira’s Poem 46) 
The deity, the temple, the act of worship are all one, as waves 
and bubbles are only water If one dances and sings before an 
image, it is the image itself that is dancing and singing Nam 
Dev regarded the remembrance of the holy Name of God as 
superior to ritual, charity or bathing in holy places He supports 
this claim with examples derived from the Puranas It is clear 
from her Padavali that Mira did not think otherwise Rememb- 
rance of the Name is the constant inner practice on the part of 
the adept, and is not confined to the repetition of the Name 
with a rosary It was so with the Teachers of the Natha school 
(Vaudeville, p 140) It was so with Nam Dev And it is still so 
with India’s holy men of the present century When Swami 
Rama Tirtha tripped and nearly stumbled over, he said ‘For 
a moment, Rama forgot Rama ” 

Remembrance of the Name, then, is a fundamental item in 
Mira’s spntual sadhana, more fundamental than the exterior 
discipline of worshipping the deity in the temple, more funda- 
mental than the singing and dancing associated with the “Mira” 
of popular conception Bui few can absorb themselves directly 
in the Absolute in its true nature as featureless (nirguna) 
Though the true nature of the Lord is to be without limitation 
or form (Mira’s “Han avinasT ), remembrance of the Name is 
usually associated with a mental image Though the devotee 
knows that any conception of the deity he may form is inade- 
quate, he nevertheless endows Him with visible form by “applying 
to his eyes the antimony of love (Brahma-Sanhita, quoted H P 
Dvivedi, Dharma Sadhana p 13) As the devout Christian imagines 
himself in the presence of Christ, so the Bhakta imagines 
himself in the presence of Krishna, Rama or Hanuman The 
Alvar Goda saw the South Indian village in which she lived as 
Brindavan, the other village-girls, her companions, as Gopis 
the villiage temple as the house of the foster-father of Krishna, 
Nanda, and the image it contained as Krishna Himself 

Similarly the Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta who was probably 
born about eighty years before Mira and with whose works she 
may well have been familiar, says “I went to Dvaraka with

Shiv Himself and held aloft a burning torch while Krishna and 
Radha danced I was so lost in the unparalleled sight that my 
hand was burnt by the torch before I was even aware of it ” 
And again “I took-the hand of that Lover of the Gopis m 
loving converse I forgot all else Even my manhood left me I 
began to sing and dance like a woman My body seemed to 
change and I became one of the Gopis I acted as a go-between 
like a woman, and began to lecture Radha for being too proud 
At such times 1 experienced moments of incomparable sweetness 
and joy He who was sitting, singing with Radha was also at 
that very time seated in my own heart ” (Chaturvedi, Madhur- 
opasana p 40 f, quoting from K M Munshi, Gujarat audits 
Literature, pp 190-1) If God is symbolized in human form as 
Krishna, then the devotee can approach God most intimately by 
imagining himself as a Gopi or as Radha Naturally this can be 
done with greatest intensity by a woman-devotee like Mira, 
already equipped by nature with a woman’s heart (Chaturvedi, 
op cit p 74, f) 

There is, however, a further point to note about Mira’s love- 
relationship with the Lord Generally speaking, devotee-poets of 
Krishna, whether they see themselves in a love relation with the 
Lord like Mira or merely depict His love-relationships with the 
Gopis or Radha, were apt to conceive the relation as an illicit 
one The Gopis are considered model devotees because, when 
they heard the sound of Krishna’s flute at night they abandoned 
their husbands and homes and sped at once to answer the call 
They preferred the tension of an illicit relationship that defied 
convention to the torpor of conformity with worldly values But 
Mira had no need to imagine an illicit relationship to demons- 
trate how a devotee defies worldly convention, as she had already 
publicly defied worldly convention by the intensity of her 
religious life and by her determination to frequent the company 
of holy men at all costs In fact Mira speaks very little of the 
Gopis (Cp Bhuvaneshvara Natha Mishra, p 196) Her poetry 
expresses her personal love-relationship with the Lord, which is 
predominantly conceived as that of an utterly dedicated Hindu 
wife 

Mira resembled Narsi Mehta and her contemporary Chaitanya 
in expressing vehement emotion by dancing and singing

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


(Chaturvedi, Sant-Parampara p 91) We have seen that it is when 
viewed in this, light that she seems furthest removed from Sants 
like Kabir and Raidas Yet in other ways she resembles them 
Raidas re-aflSrmed from outside the ranks of orthodox caste 
Hinduism the old principle of Shankara’s Advaita that no 
devotional practices are meaningful unless they lead to knowledge 
of the final truth in the end “What are dancing and singing, 
austerities and clasping of the feet, if the Truth be not known'^”' 
(kaha bhayo nace aru gaye/kaha bhayo tapa kinhem//kaha 
bhayo je carana pakare/jaumlaum tattva na cinhem*^ Viyogi 
Han, p 190) He saw this knowledge as the melting of difference 
into non-difference(tab bheda abheda samavaiga, ihid) And this 
insight into the absence of difference is attained through the grace 
of the Guru and remembrance of the Name Raidas was united 
with the Lord “like borax with gold”, and this was also Mira’s 
ideal, as we have seen 

In this refusal to remain content with worship of the Lord 
conceived in manifest form (saguna), in this demand to realize 
her final identity with the Lord, Mira stands apart from the 
great Vedantic schools of Bhakti founded by Ramanuja, Madhva, 
Nimbarka, Vallabha and Chaitanya On the other hand her 
preoccupation with temple worship in its more emotional forms 
sets her apart from the typical low-caste Sants of Northern 
India, who nevertheless agree with her that the goal of the 
spiritual life is the transcendence of all finitude (Cp Padmavati, 
p 185f ) It is not that she speaks of Krishna as “beyond form” 
(nirguna), at least in the poems here presented of the Padavali 
And yet there is some truth in the striking remark of P D 
Barathval that she was “a Gopi whose Krishna was the Absolute ” 
No doubt she is unclassifiable, as has often been said But m 
her refusal to draw a line between worship of God face to face 
and complete dissolution m the deity she seems to stand closer 
to the school of Jnaneshvara than to any other (Cp Chaturvedi, 
Madhuropasana p 82) Two texts of Jnaneshvara express in 
philosophical form the mystery of the combination of devotion 
to God with a sense of one’s final identity with God which we 
encounter in the poetry of Mira He says “If you can hew out 
of the rock a cave which contains a temple, the image of God 
and the figures of a concourse of worshippers, wh> cannot yoa

combine non-dualism with devotion*?” And again “The fact 
that intuition of non-duahty can be combined with devotion is 
a matter of immediate experience It can never be explained in 
words ” (Quoted Chaturvedi, Vaishnava Dharma p 120) 


Mira’s Poems 

Mira’s poetical works are conventionally referred to as her 
“Padavali” The word Padavali means a series of padas The 
term pada was used by the popular preachers of the Siddha and 
Natha schools who preceded Kabir The pada in its more mature 
form was a short song conveying instruction on the spiritual life, 
usually rhyming and composed in simple rhythms, adaptable for 
singing The melody (rag) to which they should be sung is speci- 
fied, and they would usually have a Dhruvak or refrain for their 
opening or second line The author’s name is incorporated in the 
last line as a kind of signature 

The great Sanskrit poet Jai Dev refers to his Gita Govinda as 
a Padavali in the proem Here the word “avail” or series has a 
special significance, as the work is conceived as suitable for 
dramatic production But this is not the case with the Padavahs 
of the popular religious poets of mediaeval India They did not 
write their poems, but just composed and sang them from time 
to time In some cases, for example m the case of Kabir, Guru 
Nanak^ Sur and Dadu, attempts were made to reduce their work 
to writing fairly soon after their death But this was not so in 
the case of Mira Her songs simply survived in the mouths of 
Itinerant singers who learned them, sang them, sometimes altered 
them and added to them, and passed them on 

Various attempts have been made from the latter part of the 
last century on to collect and print Mira’s poems and some 
manuscript collections as well as printed editions exist A modern 
edition of Mira’s poems cannot be anything more than a mis- 
cellaneous collection of songs that have come down under her 
name, pruned of extraneous material by the editor so far as he 
IS able and arranged in whatever order seemed to him good 
Acharya Chaturvedi’s edition of the Padavali first appeared well 
over thirty years ago, but on the occasion of the fifteenth edition

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


m 1^73 he subjected the text to considerable revision, partly in 
the light of material published m the intervening years and partly 
in the light of manuscript material made available to him by 
friends 

Shri Chaturvedi’s 1973 edition comprehends 202 songs, plus 
eighteen songs which include the use of the terminology of the 
Sant school, considered by him to be doubtful and placed in an 
Appendix No attempt to translate this latter group has been 
made here He also considers the songs containing conversations 
between Mira and her relatives inauthentic He accepts the poems 
in which Mira threatens to become a “login” or pictures 
Krishna as a JogI, while remarking that they should not be 
made a ground for supposing that Mira was an initiate of or 
subscribed to tenets of the Jogis of the Nath school Shri Chatur- 
vedi’s editition does not aim to be all-inclusive Svami Ananda 
Svarup’s “Mira Sudhasindhu” contains 1312 songs and Padmavati 
“Shabnam’s” “Brihad Pada Sangraha” 590 The last-named, in 
her “Miran Vyaktitva aur Krititva” (1973), has collected more 
material and suggested new methods of classification of the songs 
and comparison of the different versions Eventually a new 
picture of the Padavali may emerge, but for the present the 
edition of such an experienced hand as Shri Chaturvedi may be 
allowed to constitute a kind of standard version 

Everyone agrees that Mira’s songs have been much tailored 
and altered by the singers who sang them They are mostly in 
Rajasthani or Braj Bhasha, but also contain material in Gujarati, 
Panjabi or even Eastern Hindi (Chaturvedi, Padavah p 58) On 
the whole, the linguistic forms that have come down in the 
Padavali seem to correspond with geographical data of Mira’s 
life as reconstructed by modern scholarship Her childhood and 
youth in Rajasthan would account for the Rajasthani base Her 
travels to Braj and Dvarak and her mingling with holy men 
would account for the sprinkling of other dialects (Chaturvedi 
ibid ) 

Mira’s songs, being eminently popular and “singable” in style 
were evidently much sung in different places, and the versions of 
them which have come down to us owe part of their linguistic 
colouring to the local dialects of the singers who have sung them 
In many cases, what have come down to us as different songs are

really only different versions of one song made at different 
times by different singers (Padmavati, p 82) The more popular 
the song, the more numerous the alternative versions are apt to 
be Where there are several alternative versions of one song, the 
extra verses in the longer versions are inclined to be suspect, 
especially if any element of “modernity” is betrayed by their 
linguistic forms No doubt this helps to account for the absence 
of familiar lines in several of the poems as printed in Chaturvedi’s 
text (See eg Poems 12^ 18, 154, 193) 

The spiritual teaching in Mira’s Padavali, which is what most 
interests the person who reads her songs in English, may be 
summarized as follows, drawing largely on Acharya Chaturvedi’s 
work Mira’s expeiiences of death and bereavement in a Rajput 
family taught her the flimsiness of all worldly supports Life is 
short The body will soon mingle with the dust (Poem 156) 
Whatever mode of human life be adopted, it will be like the 
sporting of sparrows that will end at nightfall (195) Committing 
suicide at a holy place or the formal adoption of the life of a 
monk will not help, as without the intervention of the Lord one 
remains caught in the net of rebirth (195) The spectacle of the 
way people live in the world when bereft of associationship with 
holy men evokes tears (18) Without worship, man’s life is a 
poor thing, (160) a mere burden 

Mira cherished visual images of the beauty of the Lord in His 
manifest form as an adolescent boy (Kishor) in Gokul She sings 
of his divine sports She dances before His image in the temple 
(36, 37) She drinks His footwash after Puja in the temple (31) 
She ensconces His image in her heart She longs to embrace His 
feet and be His personal servant (94, 154, etc) Whatever He 
clothes her in, that she wears (20) 

The path of devotion is difficult and the devotee finds un- 
expected obstructions (54) Desire comes like a cur and imposes 
his fetters (158) Pride is like a mountain on the slopes of which 
water will not settle (158) 

Mira was loyal to her aristocratic lineage in the very courage 
with which she rejected its customs Her love was hidden at first, 
but later it expanded, like the seed of a banyan tree, for all to 
see At the beginning of her love she might have restrained it. 
But once she was in mid stream there was no turning back She 



30 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


follows the guidance of her Lord wherever it leads her, like a 
puppet attached to the thin thread of love (173) She accepts 
praise or blame with equal humility and passes on (13) 

In one sense, Mira is ever conscious of the presence of her 
Lord within her heart “Only she whose Beloved is abroad needs 
to write letters my Beloved rests ever m my heart ” (23) She 
has actually seen Him, present in her heart (darasa lahyaip 
sukha-rasi. Poem 194) Hence her every act is an act of worship 
Wherever her feet touch the earth she is dancing in love of her 
Lord (21) Yet the paradox holds that as long as worldly-Iife 
lasts He is both present and absent The lover of God is he who, 
being awake to the presence of God, feels His absence, hidden 
by the world of multiplicity, all the more keenly Shri Chaturvedi 
quotes the Indian Sufi poet Jayasi, “The nectar of the sense of 
absence abides in love like honey in the honeycomb ” Mira 
loves the Lord with the fidelity and loyalty of a young wife faced 
with the absence of her husband (66) Only those who have felt 
the gash know the pain of love- wounds (70 and 102) The sights 
and sounds of nature in spring or the rainy season only add to 
the pain 

Both the sense of the absence for the Lord and the aware- 
ness of His presence are capable of filling the devotee with such 
emotion that he is reduced to impotence In the absence of her 
Lord, Mira wishes to write Him a letter, but her hand trembles 
and she is unable Love is a state which reduces one to silence 
The Gopis distributing curds in pots are so earned away by 
the sight of Krishna that they cannot remember the word for 
curds (177) But Mira dwells with particular insistence on the 
effect of the sense of the absence of the Beloved It is felt so 
keenly as to induce a kind of madness (divani, 70, 97, 130), 
involving an indifference to all worldly objects and values A 
grain ot Sufism seems to be detectable in Mira’s mysticism, 
perhaps derived from her associationship with holy men of the 
Sant school, who themselves mingled with the Muslim mystics 
She seveial times refers to her “darad”, which prompts recall 
of a certain later Indian Sufi poet (who was indeed known as 
“Dard ) who said 

dard i dil ke waste patdd kiyd insdn ko 

varanah td^at ke liye kuch kam na the karubiydrri

He created man to suffer agonies of the heart 
If It had only been a question of obedience. 

There was not a scarcity of angels 

Mira predominantly worshipped God “with form” (saguna), 
and cannot without qualification be classed among the Sants 
But her love is of the kind that demands and presupposes iden- 
tity with its object, and when she emphasizes the identity-aspect 
her lines remind us not only of the Sants but sometimes even 
of the Upanishadic sages Adoration of the beautiful Shyam is 
the dominant theme in her poetry, but the Beloved is Himself 
said to be “like the Indestructible Principle ”(26) Mira is con- 
scious of her identity with and separation from God at the same 
time She can say “Thou and I are one like the sun and its 
heat” and “Come to my house. Thy coming will bring peace” 
in the same song (114) She speaks mysteriously of an “impene- 
trable realm, that Death himself trembles to look upon ” The 
phrasing of some lines in Mira suggests familiarity with and 
willingness to reproduce the teachings of Kabir (See Note 165 to 
Poem 158) In lines like “I care neither for Ganges nor Jumna, I 
am making my way to the sea” (Poem 24) we hear an echo of 
the ancient Upanishadic wisdom, through which the soul loses 
Its individuality and unites in perfect identity with the supreme 
Spirit She speaks of the body as a smock of five colours (the 
five elements) in which she is playing hide and seek with the 
Lord Taking into account the traditions of Mira’s childhood 
passion for the image of Krishna, and combining this with what

And art wearing Thy crocodile ear-rings. 

With Thy peacock-plume for a crown 

Thy necklace of gems is hanging from Thy neck. 

And there is Thy flute. 

Spreading forth nectar from Thy holy lips 
Thy belt is adorned with small bells. 

And the jingling of Thy anklets charms the heart

He who watches over His devotees with love 
And delights the hearts of holy men

His body is bent at the waist. 

His hands curved over the flute. 

His turban is aslant and His necklace swinging 
Mira is thrilled by the beauty of the Lord, 

Of the courtly Giridhara, dressed as a dancer

His beautiful body. His lotus-petal eyes.

I have lost all consciousness of my surroundings 
And worldly shame has fled 
How beautiful are the crescent moons 
Shimmering on His peacock-plume crown’ 

He weais a tilak-mark of saffron 
Set between His lovely eyes 

His crocodile-earrings are glinting by His cheeks. 
And His dark locks, playing in the breeze. 

Look like fish rising up from a lake 

To greet those monsters of the deep 

The Lord wears the garb of a dancer 

And His beauty has charmed the whole world 

Mira would sacrifice her all 

To every limb of the Lord Giridhara

Once they are fixed upon the Lord 

My thirsty eyes do not waver 

They drink in every atom of His body. 

Ranging with anxious longing 
From head to toe 

I was standing at the door of my house 
When Mohan passed 
He was smiling gently. 

His face radiant as the moon 

My relatives reproach me and crack bitter jests. 

But my wayward eyes brook no obstruction 
They are sold and belong to another 
Whether they praise me or chide me, 

I accept whatever is said 

And raise it reverently to my forehead 

Says Mira “Without my Master, Gindhara, 

I cannot exist for a second ”

Strange is the behaviour of my eyes 
That sweet form has entered my mind 
And pierced its way into my heart 
How long have I been standing in my house 
Gazing down the road*^ 

My very existence depends on Shyam, the Beloved 
He IS the herb that grants me life

Fortunate is she to have found His favour

Again and again I dance 
To please that discerning critic. 

And put His former love to the test 
I put on the anklets 
Of the love of Shyam,

Worldly shame and family custom

Let me go to the house of Gindhara 

Gindhara is my true lover 

On beholding His beauty, I long for Him much 

As night falls I set out to see Him 

And at break of day I return 

Day and night I sport in His company, 

I please Him in any way I can 
Whatever He clothes me in, that I wear 
Whatever He offers, that I eat ssa 
My love for Him 
Is ancient and long-standing 
Without Him I could not live 
Wherever He places me, there I remain 
If He sold me into slavery, 

I would acquiesce 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

She offers herself in sacrifice agam and again

She IS walking the woods and lanes ®® 

22 

Sister, I have bought Govind in the market 
You only speak of it secretly. 

But I proclaim it openly, beating a drum 
You say it was expensive. 

But I say it was cheap. 

And I measured it out on the scales 
I would offer my body, 

I would offer my life.

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


For a prize beyond all price 

0 Lord of Mira, grant her Thy sight 
According to Thy promise in her former birth 

23 

1 am dyed in the love of Giridhara, 

My Beloved 

0 my companion, 

1 am playing hide and seek with Him, 

Robed in this smock of five colours *8 
Disguised as I was. He caught me. 

And on beholding His beauty 

I made myself over to Him, 

Body and soul 

Only she whose Beloved is abroad 

Needs to write letters 

My Beloved rests ever m ray heart. 

He neither comes nor goes 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 

She awaits Him fervently, night and day 

24 

I have turned my back on this palace*® 

Once and for all. 

And the bolt is drawn 
My good deeds in former births 
Have come to fruition 
I have no use even for great lakes, 

Who would linger over small ponds and reservoirs 
I care neither for Ganges nor Jamna, 

I am making my way to the sea 
I do not need worldly associationships, 

I have access to the true masters 
I will not trouble with the officials, 

I will go direct to the court 

I, who beat iron with a sledge-hammer. 

Am not concerned with pewter and glass 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


43 


I trade in diamonds 

And do not care for gold and silver 

To my very great good fortune 

A mine of precious stones is at hand 

Who would forsake a cup of nectar 

To drink brackish water‘d 

My Lord, 

Now I have made acquaintance with Thy devotees 
And shun the world from afar 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
He has fulfilled her desires 


My Own Path 
25 

Mira is dyed deep in the love of Han 

And all else is blocked out 

I wear only bangles, tilak and beads 

Beyond this, my only further ornament 

Is my virtuous life 

No other embellishments please me, 

Such was the wisdom 

I received from my Teacher 

Some may revile me, others may praise me. 

But I will only sing the glories of Govind 

Wheresoever Krishna leads. 

Thither will I follow 
I will not steal, 

I will harm no one. 

How can anyone touch me*^ 

I will not descend 

From the back of an elephant 

To ride upon an ass 


26 

Come sport with me here, my companions. 
And refrain from visiting the houses of others

DeTOtional Poems of Mira Bai 


False are rubies and pearls. 

False all glamour and glimmer 
False IS all external finery, 

One’s only real necklace 

Is love of the Lord 

False are the silks of the south. 

But the rags 

Of love of the Lord are true. 

For in them the body stays pure 
Eschew nch food 

Cooked in the fifty-six kinds of condiments 
Flawed are all such enjoyments. 

But the simple diet 
Of love of one’s Lord 
Is good, cooked with salt or saltless 
Do not envy the orchards of another. 

Till thine own poor plot 
And good things will come of it 
If someone else 

Has a rich and handsome husband. 

It IS nothing to do with thee 
If you seek his society 
No one will approve 
It IS good to remain loyal 
To one’s own husband. 

Even if he be poor and a leper. 

On this all are agreed 

My Beloved is like the Indestructible Principle, 
Love of Him is true love 
The Lord has revealed Himself to Mira 
This IS the path of true devotion 


Differences of Opinion Among Friends 
27 


Sister, the Lord of the Poor 
Came to wed me in a dream 



Devotional Poems of IVfira Bai 


45 


Fifty-six crores of deities formed the bridal procession 
And the bridegroom was the Lord of Braj 
In my dream, 

I saw the wedding-arch constructed 
And the Lord took my hand 
In my dream, 

I underwent a weddmg-ceremony 
And entered the married state 
Giridhara has revealed Himself to Mira 
Her fortunes stem 
From good deeds in past births 

28 

Do not restrain me, my companion, 

I am going to visit the holy men 
Shyam’s form 

Has come to dwell in my heart. 

And I care for no other 

All the world is sleeping happily, 

But my eyes are awake 
Mad and bereft of all insight. 

Is he who rejects my Shyam, 

Shyam invades my heart 

And I cannot sleep 

No one drinks water 

From the puddles that spring up 

In the rainy months. 

But Han is a perpetual fountain of nectar. 

Which quenches my thirst 
Beautiful is Shyam, 

I am leaving now to gaze upon His face 
Mira is but a bewildered abandoned girl 
Come, accept her as Thine own 



46 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Opposition 

29 

Though He is forbidden to me, 

I cannot do without Shyam 
I will keep far away from the world 
And enjoy the company of holy men 
And the bliss of Han 
He can take my body and mind, 

As He already has my head 
My mind is fixed on Gindhara 
And cares not for the insults of the world 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible 
She says I have taken refuge with Thee 

30 

O King’ " Today I was very fortunate 
And enjoyed the company of holy men 
Those who associate with holy men 
Increase their devotion four-fold 
Do not associate with the Shaktas,^^ 

It will interfere with your devotion 
All sixty-eight places of pilgrimage 
Reside at the feet of a holy man. 

Along with Banaras and the Ganges 

Ten million times over 

Whoso abuses a holy man will go blind. 

Be crippled and end m hell 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 

She says I cover my limbs 

With the dust of the feet of holy men 

31 

Sister, I will sing the glories of Govind 

I will rise regularly at dawn 

And go to the temple to have His sight. 

And drink the water that has washed His feet 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


47 


I will dance in the temple of Han, 

Making my anklets jingle 

I will sail the boat of the Name of Shyam 

And cross the Ocean of Becoming 

This world is a thorny briar-bush 

And the road to the Beloved is blocked 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 

She will reach Him through singing His glories 


Plain Speaking 

32 

Your gorgeous kingdom does not please me 

0 King, there are no holy men in thy kingdom. 
All are liars and good-for-nothings 

1 have given up all my ornaments. 

Even my bangles, O King 

I do not plait my hair 
Or apply ointment to my eyes 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara, 

She has found the perfect bridegroom 

33 


0 my King, 

1 relish this loss of good name greatly 
Some will revile me, some will praise me. 

But I shall follow my unfathomable path 
On this narrow path 

I have met men of God ,4® 

Why turn back and abandon my unfathomable path ^ 

In the company of holy men 

I have heard spiritual teaching 

Evil ones saw me and looked on 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 

Let the evil ones burn up with hatred. 

Like coals in a brazier 



48 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


34 


0 my King, 

Why did you bear enmity against me*^ 
Why do you play the prickly cactus‘s 
Now I have left the palace 
And Its lofty towers 

1 no longer live m your city 

I have renounced antimony and tilak 
And donned the ochre robe 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara , 
He turned the poison into nectar 

35 


Sister, 

If the King of the House of Sisodiya^^ rages 
What can he do*? 

I shall continue to sing the glories of Govind 

If the King become angry 

He may keep his kingdom, and welcome ,^5 

But if Han becomes angry 

I shall lose lustre like a withering flower 

I do not observe the rules of worldly decorum 

Fearlessly, Sister will I beat the drum 

O my companion, I will sail the boat 

Of the Name of Shyam 

And cross the Ocean of Becoming 

Mira has taken refuge with the dusky Gindhara, 

Sister, she will keep close to those lotus feet 

36 


I donned anklets and danced 
The people said ‘ Mira is mad ” 

My mother-in-law declared 

That I had ruined the family s reputation 

The King sent me a cup of poison 

Which I drank with a smile 

I have offered body and mind 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


49 


To the feet of Han, 

And will drink the nectar of His holy sight 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
My Lord, to Thee^® will I go for refuge 


Testing 

37 

I am dyed deep in the love of Shyam, 

My King, dyed deep in the love of Shyam 
I danced before the holy men. 

Beating the drum 

People think am mad over Madan, 

That love of Shyam has driven me silly 
The King sent me a cup of poison 
Which I gulped down without even a look 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

His love IS true, birth after birth 

38 

I knew the Queen*"^ had sent me poison 

When gold is placed in fire 

It emerges shining like the sun 

I have thrown away worldly shame 

As one throws away dirty water 

You observe purdah in your place, my Queen, 

But I am just a poor mad girl 

An arrow from the quiver of love 

Has pierced my heart and driven me crazy 

I offer my body and mind 

As a sacrifice to all holy men. 

And I hug closely those lotus feet 

The Lord has taken®® Mira into his protection. 

Knowing her to be His servant 



50 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


39 

Sister, I will sing the glories of Govind 
If the King shows displeasure 
I can leave his kingdom, 

But if Han shows displeasure 
Whither can I retreat*? 

The King sent me a cup of poison 
And I accepted it as nectar, 

As the very foot- wash of the Lord ** 

He sent me a black serpent. 

Hidden in a basket. 

And I worshipped it 

As the black stone that embodies Vishnu 
Now Mira has gone veritably mad with love. 
She has obtained Shyam for her bridegroom 

40 

This love. Sister, is a love that endures 

I have drunk from the cup of nectar 

And It has set me in a spin 

They cannot sober me, however they try 

The King sent a snake in a basket 

And they gave it to the Princess of Merata®^ 

To put on her neck 

Mira donned it smiling. 

Thinking “This is my best necklace 
The King prepared a cup of poison 
Which they gave to the princess to drink 
She drank it up 

Like the foot-wash of the Lord, 

Singing the glories of Govind 
I have drunk from the cup 
Of the Holy Name, 

And nothing else pleases me 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara, 

His love is paint that does not peel 



Devotional Poems of IVGra Bai 


41 

Mira has been singing the glones of Govind 
And IS immersed in joy 
The Kmg sent a snake m a basket 
They came and placed it m Mira’s hand 
I washed and came to look at it. 

And behold ’ 

It was the Black Stone of Vishnu 
The Kmg sent a cup of poison, 

But my Lord converted it into nectar 
When I washed my hand and drank. 

Behold ^ It was nectar 

The Kmg sent a mattress of thorns, 

Saying “Give that to Mira to sleep upon ” 
When evening came and Mira lay down. 
Behold ’ It was a bed of flowers 
Mira’s Lord ever stands as her helper 
And preserves her from dangers 
She wanders about recklessly. 

Drunk in adoration, 

Ofienng herself to Gindhara in total sacrifice 

42 

O Sister without Han I cannot live 
My mother-in-law fights with me. 

My sister-in-law scolds me. 

The King is permanently m a rage 
They have bolted my door 
And mounted a guard outside it 
Why should I abandon my ancient love 
Inherited from earlier births'^ 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
And she will be satisfied with nothing else 



52 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Sufferings in Absence 
43 

I do not know how to meet my Lord 
He came into my courtyard and went. 

And I only know that I missed Him 
1 spend days in search. 

Scanning the road night and day 
Han came into my courtyard. 

But, wretch that I am, 

I was asleep 

The pam of absence bums my bewildered heart 
And gives me no rest 
O Servant Mira, 

Whoso once meets Lai Giridhara 
Should never let go 


44 


0 Jogi,®* I scan the road 
Searching for Thee day and night 

My feet will not tread tho difficult path 
It is strange, and has many pitfalls 
A Jogi came to the city. 

But found not love in my heart and left 
Artless as I was, 

1 failed to entrap and hold Him 

Since then I have searched for many days. 

But still He has not returned 

Come and quench the longing in my heart, 

A veritable fire is raging in my body 

Either the Jogi is no longer alive 

Or else He has forgotten me completely 

What can I do‘> where shall I go*^ 

Sister, tears have rendered my eyes useless 
My Lord, I long for Thee in my heart. 
Come, knowing me to be Thine 
Mira feels abandoned and perplexed 
Without Thee, she can only pant and sigh 



Devotional Poems of IVfira Bai 


53 


45 

My thirsty eyes are longung for His sight 
Whole days have I passed. Sister, 

In scanning the road 

The pain in my eyes is great 

A cuckoo has been smging from a branch. 

And Its song has pierced me deeply “ 

The elders speak bitter words 
And crack jokes at my expense 
But Mira is sold into Han’s hands. 

His slave for birth upon birth 


46 


0 Jogi, do not depart, 

1 pray you, do not depart 

Behold, I fall at Your feet. Your slave 

Strange is the path of love and devotion > 

Explain to me its intricacies 

Before You depart 

I am laying a pyre of fragrant aloe 

And sandalwood 

Light It with Your own hand 

Before You depart 

When I am burnt to a heap of ashes. 

Smear them on Your body 
Before You depart 

Says Mira to her Lord, the courtly Gindhara, 
Let my light dissolve in Your light 
Before You depart 


47 

0 Gindhara Lai, You enjoyed a feast 
Servant Mira begged a boon. 

And my dear Krishna showed His compassion 
He who protects and nounshes His servants 
Accepted a savoury dish 

1 held the platter before Him 



54 


Derotional Poems of Mira Bai 


While Giridhara feasted royally 
Servant Mira will take refuge with Thee, 
Grant her contentment soon 


48 

Do not go off and abandon me, my Lord 
Weak woman as I am, 

Giridhara is my strength 

He IS my Master 

I am quite without merit 

While Giridhara possesses every virtue 

His presence bejewels my heart 

You are the Saviour of the World 

And the remover of all affliction 

You came to the rescue of the elephant 

I place my ruined life 

In the shadow of Your protection 

Where else could I go, O King of Braj"^ 

Mira recognizes no other Master, 

Now spare her from further ignominy 

49 


Where are You going. 

Having lit the flames of love? 

Without Your sight I enjoy no repose. 
Life IS suffocating and will not last 
I will become a wandering Jogmi 
For Your sake. 

Or end my life beneath the saw of Kashi 

50 

0 my Beloved, stay before my eyes 
Do not forget me, 

1 am drowning in the Ocean of Becoming, 
Remember me soon 

The King has sent me a cup of poison. 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


55 


Grant the boon that it may become nectar 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Girdhara, 

Do not leave me when once we have met 

51 


What shall I say to you, 

0 my Shyam Gindhara’ 

My love is ancient 

And runs from former births. 

Do not abandon me, Giridhara 

1 offer myself in unconditional sacrifice, my darling. 
When I behold Thy beautiful face 

Come into my courtyard, Giridhara, 

The women are singing auspicious hymns 
1 have set aside a square for Thy welcome. 

Heaped with the pearls of my tears 
I cast myself before Thee, body and mind 
Servant Mira takes refuge at Thy feet 
For Thy sake she has remained a virgin 
From birth to birth 


Reproaches 

52 

Sister, behold how Han has hardened His heart' 
He said He would come, 

But has not done so 

That was His promise when He went 

Food, drink and my surroundings. 

Are all forgotten 
Why does my life go on*^ 

Thy actions belie Thy words, my Master, 

How couldst Thou have forgotten me'^ 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 
She says Without Thee I am heart-broken 



56 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


53 


To fall in love with a Jogi 
Is to court pain 

I loved, but it has brought me no joy. 

My sister 

The Jogi befriends no one 
Until I meet Thee again, 

I shall have no rest, day or night 
Never again in this world 
Have I beheld beauty like Thine 
Mira says My Lord, when shall we meet? 
Great will be the joy of that meeting 

54 


To love a Jogi brings pain 
He speaks sweet words 
When you are with him. 

But then He forgets you and goes 
Sister, He snaps the ties of love 
As you might pluck a sprig of jasmine 
Says Mira My Lord, 

Without Thy sight my heart grieves sorely 

55 

One day, perhaps, you will remember me. 

My wandering Krishna,®® so aloof 
You took up your seat 
In motionless contemplation. 

As is proper on the path of devotion 
I thought You would take me when You went. 
But You left me behind in the lurch 
You do not see a Jogi come, 

Y ou do not see him go 

Who can say that a Jogi is his friend‘d 

Says Mira O my courtly Gindhara, 

My mind has gone to your feet 



Deyotional Poems of Mira Bai 


57 


56 

0 Mohan, I know your ways of lo^ e. 
Know them well 

Mine IS the Path of Love and Devotion, 

1 know no other 

Why, having first plied me with nectar. 
Do you serve me with poison now*^ 
Where did you learn manners like this? 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible 
He is the true friend of His devotees 

57 

Let Him go, let Him go, my companion > 
To whom is a Jogi a friend*? 

He remains ever indifferent to me. 
Utterly peculiar in his behaviour 
He seems to speak sweetly. 

But never gives His love 
I thought the affair would succeed. 

But He left me®® half-way and went off 
Mira’s Lord is the dehghtful Shyam, 
Dear because the object of her love ' 

58 


Come, Jogi, smile and talk. 

Your lofty indifference®® is a sham 

I’ve told the whole world now, Manamohan,®i 

To the beat of a drum 

Come, You with the deer-skm 

And the ash-smeared body — 

Just tell the people the truth 

Thy face has the beauty of a new-born®^ lotus, 

I stand and gaze at Thy cheeks 

I have neither beads, nor ashes. 

Nor horn nor seli 

Open Thy mouth, O Silent One. 

Do not wander from door to door. 



58 


Devotimial Poems of Mira Bai 


Flaunting Thy youth and piercing eyes 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible 
She has sold herself in slavery to Him 
Without accepting a fee 


59 

0 Knshna,«s o All-Pervading One, 

My love is for Thee alone 

When love has once set in, my dearest. 

Do not break it off, 

But go on increasing Thy affection instead 
Had I known what pam arose from love, 

My dearest, 

1 would have proclaimed “Let no one love” 
All over the town with an enormous drum 
Do not make friends with fools 

Sister, leave that treacherous dish alone •“ 
Now they are warm, now cold. 

Now your accomplice, now your enemy 
To love is madness 

But those who, having once given their love. 
Retract it later, are cruel 
He IS a rare hero who loves on. 

Trampling all opposition underfoot 
Thou art strong like a well-cemented terrace. 
And I am weak like a wall of sand 
How can I now revive that love 
I enjoyed in former births'^ 

You may plant in the same place 
A mango and an acacia, 

But the one will still yield a sweet drink 

And the other thorns 

Love With the fickle-minded 

Is like a thin stream descending from a height 

It flows freely and froths much 

But soon announces its exhaustion 

Now the rainy months have come 

And the cry of the peacock is heard 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


59 


Caught in the puffs of a divine breeze 
Mira has been wafted away 
To join the devotees of Han 


60 


0 Giridhara, 

Why hast Thou become angry with me*? 
Recount some of my faults, 

1 am eager to hear 

I have been Thy slave for many births 
And Thou art my excellent Master 
Says Mira O my Lord, 

0 Gmdhara the courtly one, 

1 take Thy Name and Thine alone 


Hymns of Praise 
61 

Han, 

Thou didst remove the afBiictions of Thy devotees 
Thou didst spare the shame of Draupadi®® 

By continually lengthening her dress 

Thou didst assume the form of a Man-Lion 

To save Thy devotee Prahlad 

Thou didst save the Elephant from drowning 

Mira is the servant of Lai Giridhara 

He has removed all my afflictions 

62 


Take my arm immediately. 

If only to preserve Thine own reputation 

0 Giridhara they call Thee 
The Refuge of the Afflicted 

Thou hast promised to save the fallen 

1 am plunged in the ocean of transmigration 
Without a support 



60 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Without Thee, I shall suffer a mighty disaster 
Thou savest Thy devotees from their af9ictions 
In every age, 

Appearing before them to grant them release 
Mira has taken refuge with Thee, 

And is grasping Thy feet 
Redeem Thy pledge,’'* O King 

63 

Without Han, behold my wretched condition 
They say that Thou art my protector 
And I Thy servant 

I have practised remembrance of Thy Name 

In my heart, day and night 

Again and again I call upon Thee 

In grievous affliction 

This world is a threatening sea. 

Surrounding me on every side 
My boat has broken. 

Hoist the sail quickly 
Before it sinks 

This forlorn one waits anxiously for her Lord, 

Grant her Thy proximity 

Servant Mira repeats “Ram Ram'”^® 

I take refuge in Thee alone 


64 

My Lord, You have inspired me with love. 

Where have You now gone‘> 

You have abandoned me. Your faithful companion. 

Having ht the flame of love 

You have set the boat of love in motion 

And abandoned it on the ocean of longing 

My Lord, when can I meet You‘> 

Without You, I cannot survive 

65 

The Charmer of Hearts has gone. 

Having caught me in the noose of love 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


61 


On the bough of a mango tree 
A cuckoo IS pouring forth her plaintive song 
The world just laughs. 

But for me it is death 
I tramp the forests 

In desolation at the absence of the Beloved 
Let me die, 

Let me perish in the saw at Kashi 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible 
Thou art my Master and I Thy servant 

66 

Sister, Han will not speak to me. 

Why does not my wretched breath 
Abandon my body'^ 

The night passed 

And I neither removed my veil nor spoke ’’ 

An age has passed without converse. 

How can I prosper in conditions like this‘s 
I heard that Han would come in the ’•amy season 
The nights were thick with darkness. 

Lightning flashed 

And I would count the hours till dawn 
Servant Mira is dyed in the love of Shyam 
Her whole life passes in longing 

67 


I am invaded by memories 

Of the conduct of the supremely affectionate Krishna 

Krishna belongs to me 

And I belong to Him 

Without Him, nothing pleases me 

He said He would come but has not appeared, 

My heart is deeply distraught 
My only desire, O Krishna, 

Is to enjoy vision of Thee 

When will Han grant me His holy sight‘d 



62 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Deep IS my love for those lotus feet. 

And without His sight I suffer greatly 
When Mira’s Lord grants her His sight 
Her joy will be beyond description 

68 

My darkling Beloved has gone abroad 
My lost one has not returned 
Or even sent me a message 
I have put off my jewelry 
And shaved my hair 

For Thy sake have I donned the orange robe 
And gone forth searching the four quarters 
Says Mira O my Lord Shyam, 

Unless I can be with Thee, 

My birth and life are but an affliction 

69 


0 my companion. 

Without Shyam I cannot survive 
Charmed by Thy beauty, O my Beloved, 

1 offer Thee my body, mind and life 

I have lost all appetite for food and drink 
And my eyes have gone dim 

0 Muran,™ day and night 

1 dream of meeting Thee, 

When shall I have Thy sight‘d 
Days and nights pass 

As I call upon Thee 
Says Mira O Han, 

Without Thee my life flickers feebly on 

70 


I am mad with love 

And no one understands my plight 

Only the wounded 

Understand the agonies of the wounded. 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


63 


When a fire rages in the heart 

Only the jeweller knows the value of the jewel. 

Not the one who lets it go 

In pain I wandered from door to door. 

But could not find a doctor 
Says Mira Harken, my Master, 

Mira’s pain will subside 

When Shyam comes as the doctor 

71 


Without my beloved Master 
I cannot live 
Body, mind and life 
Have I given to the Beloved 
Fascinated by His beauty, 

I gaze down the road 
Night and day 

Says Mira My Lord, accept your servant — 
It IS all she asks 


72 

The link between me and Shyam 
Cannot be broken 
I went yellow as the autumn leaf 
And the people thought I had jaundice 
My father sent for the doctor. 

Who felt my pulse 

It was my heart that was breaking. 

But the doctor did not know the secret 
My Lord, Mira is distressed in Your absence. 
Come and grant her Your sight 

73 


Who can understand the grief 

Of a woman parted from her beloved’ 

Only one who has felt the pangs of absence. 
Or perhaps a devotee 



64 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


The physician is present within the patient 
Only the physician knows the remedy 
The dagger®^ of the absence of the Beloved 
Has pierced my breast 
Without Han, all pleasures are as dust 
I am like a mad cow roaming the forest, 
Who can think only of her lost calf 
The Chatak dreams of the rain of Swati,®* 
Crying “Lord, Lord”®® in great distress 
The world is all thorns, 

A veritable garbage-heap. 

And no one sees my pain 

Krishna is Mira’s Lord and Master 

She could not find another if she sought ®® 

74 

Without Krishna I cannot sleep 
Tortured by longing, I cannot sleep. 

And the fire of love 

Drives me to wander hither and thither 
Without the light of the Beloved 
My house is dark. 

And lamps do not please me 

Without the Beloved my bed is uninviting 

And I pass the nights awake 

When will my Beloved return home‘s 

The frogs are croaking, the peacock’s cry 

And the cuckoo’s song are heard 

Low black clouds are gathering. 

Lightning flashes, stirring fear in the heart 

My eyes fill with tears 

What shall I do‘> Where shall I go*^ 

Who can quench my pain‘d 
My body has been bitten 
By the snake of “absence”. 

And my life is ebbing away 
With every beat of the heart 
Fetch the herb quickly 



Derotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Which of my companions 

Will come bringing the Beloved to meet me*^ 

My Lord when will you come 

To meet your Mira‘S 

Manamohan, the Charmer of Hearts, 

Fills me with delight When, my Lord, 

Will you come to laugh and talk with me*^ 

75 

Sleep has not visited me the whole night. 

Will the dawn ever come*^ 

0 my companion. 

Once I awoke with a start from a dream 
Now the remembrance of that vision 
Never fades 

My life IS ebbing as I choke and sigh, 

When will the Lord of the Afflicted come*^ 

1 have lost my senses and gone mad. 

But the Lord knows my secret 

He who deals out life and death 
Knows the secret of Mira’s pain 

76 

How can I finish a letter 

When I cannot even write‘s 

My hand trembles when I take up the pen 

And my eyes flood with tears 

When I want to say anything 

I cannot speak 

My heart is sore afraid 

You have beheld my plight 

Go to Han, and beg of Mira’s Lord, 

The courtly Giridhara, 

That He may keep a place for her 
At His lotus feet 


77 

In the absence of the Beloved 

The sports of Hofis’ leave a bitter taste 



66 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


The whole village seems mournful. 

Mournful one’s'’ bed and house 

This abandoned one wanders about mournfully 

Without her Beloved 

The Beloved has left her and gone off, 

Leaving her afflicted with the pain of absence 
Do not keep travelling from place to place. 

My anxiety is heavy 
I have blurred the lines on my fingers 
With counting O Murari,®^ come’ 

They are playing the flutes and drums 
And the one-stringed lute 
Spring has come, but the Beloved has not 
My pain grows deeper. 

Why have you forgotten me, Shyam‘> 

O Gindhara, I stand before You in supplication 
Spare my shame 

Says Mira O Madhav,®* O my Master, 

For Thy sake have I preserved virginity 
Birth after birth Come to my side 
My mind has taken full refuge in Thee 

78 


I take no pleasure in Hoh 
Without the presence of my Beloved 
My house and its courtyard 
Are alike repellent 

Sister, the place of honour in my house 
Is filled with lamps®^ 

To honour my distant Lord 
My empty bed seems like a snake 
Sleep will not come to my eyes. 

How will the night pass'> 

How long have I been standing 

Gazing down the road‘s 

The pain of absence keeps me awake 

Night and day 

To whom can I recount 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


67 


The sufferings of my mind*^ 

My heart remains uneasy. 

When will the Beloved come*^ 

I see no dear soul 
Kind enough to take a message 
When will I have the chance 
To smile and embrace the Beloved 
Then would Mira sing the songs of Holi 

80 

The Beloved has abandoned me. 

With whom could I play Holp®® 

I have taken off all gems and pearls 
And donned the yogi’s beads 
Neither food nor house please me. 

The Beloved has driven me mad 
Why did He subject me 
To the pain of absence*^ 

If You are now making love to another 
Why did You make love to me first'’ 

Many days have passed 
And still He has not come 
O my companion, I am disturbed 
Who can be holding Him back'’ 

Without Shyam my life-force shrivels and contracts 
Like a plant with water 
O my Master, 

Mira has been Thy servant birth after birth. 

Grant her Thy sight 

Without Thy sight 

She can only stand in sorrow 


81 

See, the tumbling clouds hove come. 

But they have not brought a message from Han 
The songs of the frog, the peacock. 

The papiha and the koil are heard 
All is thick darkness 



68 


Derotional Poems of JVdDra Bai 


When suddenly the lightning flashes. 
Causing great trepidation 
To her whose Beloved is absent 
Thunder rolls, 

A sweet, soft breeze sets in. 

With steady rain 

Now the snake of “absence” 

Bites really hard 

Han has captured Mira’s heart 

82 

O Shyam, I saw a ram-cloud bursting. 

And burst into tears myself 

The clouds massed black and yellow. 

And rained for two hours on end 
Wherever I look there is water, water 
Green herbage has covered the thirsty earth 
My Beloved has gone abroad. 

And I have become drenched 
Standing at the door waiting for Him 
Mira says O my Master, the eternal Han, 
Fulfil the obligations of sincere love 


In the Throes of Longing 
83 

Whence arose those feelings of spite 
That you suddenly remembered, O Papiha 
I was sleeping in my house 
When your cry came “Darling, darling” 

It was salt on my wounds, 

An axe®s laid at my heart 
You were perched on the branch 
Of a tall tree. 

Singing at the top of your voice 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara, 

She has laid her mind at His feet 



Deyotional Poems of Mora Bai

84 


0 Papiha, 

Do not call out for the Beloved 

If one in the throes of absence should hear you 

She would twist off your wings 

And throw them away 

1 will get them to cut off your beak 
And will pour black salt on the wound 
I belong to the Beloved 

And He belongs to me alone 
Who are you to call Him “darhng”*^ 

Yet if I should meet the Beloved today 

Your voice would sound sweet 

I would gild your beak 

And make you my pet 

I will write the Beloved a letter 

Take it for me, friend crow 

Tell the Beloved 

That His abandoned one is not eating 
Servant Mira is in distress. 

Passing the time calling out for the Beloved 
Come quickly O Master, O Inner Ruler, 
Without Thee I cannot survive 

85 


0 my companion. 

My “Charmer of Hearts” has not come 
Perhaps he has taken up the life 
Of a holy man 

Or has He simply forgotten the way*^ 

What shall I do*? Where shall I go 
Now the pain of absence is deeply disturbing 
Servant Mira is thirsty for Thy sight 
Her mind has gone to the feet of Han 

86 

1 sit up awake while the world sleeps 

The abandoned one sits in the pleasure-palace.

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Threading the pearls of her tears 
Just such an abandoned one once I saw 
Threading a necklace from her tears 
I pass the night counting the stars 
Awaiting the hours of joy 
Mira says O my Lord Gindhara, 

Come, for this separation*^ must end 

87 

Friend, I have lost all sleep 
I spend the whole night 
Watching and waiting for the Beloved 
My companions came to lecture me, 

But my mind would not listen 
Without seeing Him I cannot rest. 

Yet I will not be angry 

My body is thin, I am greatly distracted, 

My lips keep repeating the word “darling” 

You did not understand 

The agonies I suffered in separation. 

The pain of my heart 

The chatak bird thinks only of the cloud. 

The stranded fish thinks only of the sea 
Mira, too, is abandoned and distracted 
She has lost consciousness of her surroundings 

88 

That dark form has entered my heart 
I meditate on Gindhara night and day. 

And Mohan surely abides in my heart 
I am bitten by the snake of love of Shyam 
And stand utterly bewildered 
Says Mira O my Master, 

When will You come ? 

Every day finds me filled with love anew 

89 

Sister, without the Lord I cannot carry on 
My life-force is failing. 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


71 


Without Han I cannot carry on 
The tortoise and the frog live in water. 

And from water were they born 
But greater is the fish 

Take him from water and he immediately dies 

The log has fallen in the forest 

And the weevils®^ are attacking it savagely 

But if the Lord came 

And threw it into the fire. 

Behold * It would burn to ashes 
I wander from wood to wood. 

Hardly retaining consciousness 
Grant me Thy sight but once 
And all my evils will cease 
I have turned yellow as a sear leaf 
And am visited with sore pain 

0 Lai Giridhara, this is Thy servant Mira 
Through meeting Thee she has now found joy 

90 

Sister’ Without Hari, how can I live*? 

Without Shyam I have gone crazy. 

My mind is like wood attacked by weevils 

The pain of love is devouring me 

And no medicine avails 

When the fish is sundered from the water 

It flaps feebly and dies 

1 search endlessly for Shyam in the forests. 
Drawn on by the sound of the flute 

Says Mira O Lai Giridhara, my Master, 
Come quickly to my side 


91 

My companion, a deep longing to meet Shyam 
Has arisen within me 
I toss and turn and find no ease, 

The fire ot ‘absence” has set in 
I call out for the Belc ved 



72 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bm 


Night and day, abandoning worldly shame 
And family custom 

The snake of separation has bitten my heart, 
And now it pumps jets of poison 
Mira is miserable and utterly bewildered, 
Her desire for Shyam is deep 


92 

Shyam, without Thee I cannot sleep 
Every second seems many an age. 

Every moment I am tortured by separation 
Without the Beloved*® I remain in tlarkness. 

Neither lamps nor palaces please me 

A bed of jfiowers seems abed ofihoins 

And I pass my nights awake 

To whom can I speak 

Who would believe me 

Who would have faith in my words ^ 

The Beloved is a snake 
Who has bitten my hand. 

And my life is ebbing with every pulse 
I hear the frog’s croaking, the peacock’s cry 
And the song of the koil and paplha 
Dark low clouds have gathered. 

The lightning’s flash inspires terror 

0 Krishna,^®® 

Is there any loving soul in the world 
Who will ease my pain 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible 
His sight would refresh her eyes 

93 

1 have sacrificed my life 
Unto the beautiful Shyam 
For Thy sake, O Shyam, 

I have abandoned worldly shame and family custom 

Without His sight I find no rest 

And streams of tears fall from my eyes 



I>evof:ional Poems of NUra Bm 


To whom could I speak ^ 

Who could assuage my pain 
The river of separation is a powerful stream 
Says Mira Harken, Lord, grant me Thy sight. 
For Thy feet are my only support 

94 

0 Shyam, hear my pitiful prayer 

1 will remain Thy faithful servant 

I am mad with desire for Thy sigat 

And the plague of separation has attacked me 

For Thy sake I will become a Jogini 

And wander from city to city 

I will seek Thee m every nook 

I will don ashes and deer-skin. 

And will veritably reduce this body to ashes 
K.rishna,ioi the Indestructible, has not yet come 
I will wander from wood to wood. 

Weeping and calling out 

0 Giridhara, 

Come to the side of Thy devotee Mira, 

It will end her pam and bring abundant joy 
Now there is peace m my breast. 

Through and through 
My wanderings are at an end 

1 shall remain at Thy feet. 

Thy servant for ever 


95 

Come straight away to my house,!®® 

O my Beloved 

Thou art mine and I am Thine 
I, Thy devotee, await Thee expectantly. 
Gazing eagerly down the road 
Time has passed. 

And still Thou hast not come 
Hast Thou fallen in love 
With my messenger 



74 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Says Mira O my Master, 

When wilt Thou come 

Without Thy sight the days are hard 

96 

Come to my house, O Lord of the Universe ’ 
My body is in pain, my breath burning 
Come and extinguish the fire of separation 
I spend the nights roving about in tears 
Appetite and sleep have left me. 

But my shameless life clings on 
Grant me happiness, do not desolate me 
Delay no longer. 

Thy abandoned Mira is in sore straits 

97 


0 Jogi, 

If You would but grant me Your sight. 

Great would be my joy 

Otherwise life on earth is only pain, 

A continuous suffering in Your absence. 
Day and night 

My sufferings have driven me mad, 

1 have tramped the whole country through 
Mira has been Your true servant. 

Now her black hair has turned white 


98 


Come to my house, O Jogi, 

With Thy ear-rings. Thy beads 
And Thy ash-smeared body 
Without Thy sight I feel no rest 
I am happy neither in the house 
Nor the courtyard 

Han, the Indestructible is Mira ^ 1 o-i. 
Come and grant me Thv bi^m 



DeTotional Poems of Mira Bai 


75 


99 


Come, O Charmer of Hearts, 

1 am waiting expectantly 
I do not touch food or drink. 

Nor do my eyelids close in sleep 
In Thy absence I can enjoy nothing 
And my heart is deeply despondent 
Without Thee, Mira has gone demented 
Do not leave her supportless 

100 


Come, Charmer of Hearts, 

For Your speech is sweet 

0 Krishna, did You ever rightly value 
My childhood love ? 

Without Your sight I feel no ease. 

My mind swings this way and that 
Mira says I am Yours 

1 will proclaim this, with Your permission. 
To the beat of a drum 


101 

My darling, grant me Your sight, 

I cannot exist without You 

Life without You 

Is like a pond without a lotus. 

Or a night without the moon 
I pass the nights in deep distress. 

The pain of absence eats my heart 
No food by day, no sleep by night. 

No words pass my lips either 

Who will listen to me 

To whom can I speak 

Come, mj Beloved, and quench my pain 

Why do You torment me, O Inner Ruler 

If You came, my pain would go 

Mira is Your servant. 

Her Love^o^ has run for many births 



76 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


102 


Without Thy sight 
I cannot rest a minute 
My house looks ugly, 

Sleep deserts me. 

And I am plagued by the sense of absence 
I wander about like a wounded thing 
And no one knows my pain 
My life is ebbing, I wither. 

My eyes are blurred with tears 
I stand and stand in expectation. 

Gazing down Thy path 

Says Mira When shall I meet Y ou. 

My Lord ? To meet You 
Would bring joy 


103 


Without Thy sight 

Sorrow attends my eyes 

When I fancy I hear Thy words. 

My heart trembles 
Sweet is Thy voice 

To whom can I explain my sufferings 

I am being mangled in the jaws 

Of the circular saw of “pain of absence” 

0 Han, I gaze down Thy path, 

1 experience no peace 

And a night seems like half a year 

I toss and turn in Thy absence 

And peace and joy are gone 

Says Mira My Lord, when will You come 

Your coming will end my sorrows 

And bring joy 


104 

Why do You torment me 

For Your sake I abandoned the world 

And my family 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bii 


77 


Why do You now forget me 
You lit the fire of the pain of absence. 
But You have not returned to put it out 
You cannot escape me now, Murari, 

I have come forward to grasp Your feet 
Mira has been Thy slave for many births 
Thou hast promised to save Thy devotees. 
Redeem Thy pledge 


105 

My love for Thee has set in deeply, 

0 courtly Son of Nand 

Having heard the music of Thy flute 

1 have forgotten family and home 
When the fish is dying on the bank 
The water knows nothing of its pain 
The moth is burnt to ashes 

And the flame knows not its agonies 
Says Mira O Shyam, my Master, 

Without Thee I remain in embodied existence, 
But can I be said to live 


106 

Thou art my companion of many births, 
I do not forget Thee day or night 
Without Thee I can enjoy no peace. 

My heart knows it well 
I climbed a high place 
To scan Thy path 

I suffered sorely and my eyes grew red 
False IS the ocean of transmigration, 
False IS bondage to the world, 

False all family ties 
I gaze at Thy form every moment 
And feel the intoxication of Thy beauty 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 
Her mind is dyed in the feet of Han 



78 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


107 

My beloved, think of me as Thou wilt, 

I have no other refuge but Thee, 

Grant me Thy grace 
I do not eat by day 
Or sleep by night 

My body is wasting away every moment 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 
Come to her. 

And do not forsake her again 

108 

Deep IS my longing to meet with Shyam 
Every day I rise early 
And wait for Him in expectation 
Many days have passed in torment, 

I am caught in the net of longing 

Show me Thy compassion soon, my Master, 

Am I not Thy slave 

My weary eyes long for Thy sight, 

My breath will hardly emerge from my body 
Day and night my only thought is 
“When will Han keep me by His side 
Mine IS a love that will not lapse. 

Why do you still make mischief 

0 Master of Mira, 

When will You come 'f 

Your coming will fulfil all my desires 

109 

Come to my house, my darling, my Beloved 

1 will offer You my eyes 
As a carpet to walk upon. 

My heart as a couch. 

And will seat You ensconced upon my head 
O my guest. 

Thy coming will benefit me greatly.

For Thy mission is salvation from the world 
Thou hast rescued Thy devotees 
From various evil plights. 

And assured them the rewards 
Of all their pious deeds 

Mira says O my Master, the courtly Giridhara, 
Grasp my arm and spare my shame 

110 


0 my companion, 

When will my Beloved come"^ 

Surely the lotus feet of the courtly Giridhara 
Will grant me joy. 

For I have fastened my eyes upon them 
Deep is my desire to see Thee, 

To behold Thy face 
My wits are disturbed. 

My very life insecure. 

Come quickly to relieve ray pain 

Says Mira O my Master, the courtly Giridhara, 

Without Thee my sufferings are great 

111 

Think of me as Thou wilt, 

1 am gazing down Thy path 
Every moment Grant me Thy sight 
I am full of defects. 

But consider not my defects 
I am a slave to Thy lotus feet. 

Come to me and do not depart 
Says Mira I have taken refuge 
With the true Teacher, 

And have applied my mind 
To the feet of Han 


112 

Come to my house, my Beloved, my dearest 
Without Thee, the whole world tastes bitter 



80 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


I will ofFef you my body, my mmd 
And my worldly possessions. 

And will perform Thy worship 
Thou art a vast of ocean of virtues 
And I a mass of defects 
I am worthless, without a single grace, 

But Thou art forgiving 

Says Mira My master, when will You come*^ 
Without You my eyes feel sore pain 

113 

0 Krishna, offering myself completely m sacrifice, 

1 beg of You to come to my street 
Without Thy sight I feel no ease 
And can only gaze down Thy path 
Who IS Your new lady-love. 

Dearer to You than P 

Be compassionate and grant me Thy sight. 

Overlooking all my faults 

O Murari, Thou an supremely compassionate 

To those who take refuge at Thy feet

114 

Come to my house, O Krishna, 

Thy coming will bring peace 
Great will be my joy if I meet Thee, 

And all my desires will be fulfilled 
Thou and I are one. 

Like the sun and its heat 

Mira’s heart cares for nothing else. 

It only wants the beautiful Shyam 

115 

O Beloved, grant me Thy sight 
Again and again I call out to Thee, 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


81 


Grant me Thy grace 
In the hot weather of late May 
The land is dessicated, the birds suffer 
As May gives way to June, 

The peacock cries out piteously 
And the cuckoo wails for the clouds 
When the rams set in. 

The women observe the Tij festival 
In the month of Bhadon 
The rivers swirl — 

No one absents themselves then 
In the month of Kwar, 

The oyster-shells hanker for ram 
In the month of Karttik 
People worship in the temple. 

But in my case, 

Thou art my only divinity 
Cold are the days of Margashirsh, 

So come quickly to protect me 

In the month of Paush 

The earth is covered with thick frost, 

Come Yourself to see it 

In the month of Magh 

They celebrate Vasant Pancham! 

In Phalgun they sing songs 

They celebrate Holi with mirth and games 

And bum whole woods in bonfires 

In the month of Chaitra 

Longing rises m the heart— 

Grant me Thy sight 
In the month of Vaishakh 
The trees burst into blossom. 

And the cuckoo sings his plaintive song 
The day has passed m driving off crows'^* 
And I have also consulted the astrologers 
Mira is abandoned and miserable 
When will she have His sight*^^“ 



82 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


116 


O Jogi, come to this land 
Let me see Thee with my eyes. 

And run to prostrate before Thee 
With my humble petition 
The rainy season has come. 

Dry land, nvers and tanks 

Are all flooded 

Who IS holding You back, 

A prisoner of love‘s 

Your abandoned one is deeply distraught 
The rainy season is now long over. 

But nothing hinders my power to weep 

Just alter direction 

And come to our city 

That beautiful form 

Has taken up its station in my heart. 

And I can hardly live any longer 
Mira has no other possession but Thee 
Come to her and grant her Thy sight 

117 

Take my humble petition to the Jogi 

0 my companion, the Jogi is very wise 
Even Shiv and Shesh^i* meditate upon Him 

1 will come ’ I will not remain 

In a distant place, parted from the Beloved 

0 my protector, be gracious 
And keep me by Thy side 
My Dearest, 

1 will don the beads, ear-rings and belt. 

And will take the begging-bowl m my hands 
I will become a wandering Jogini, 

And will search long ages 
Till I enjoy Thy presence at last 
The Beloved said He would come 
In the rainy season 
He made many promises. 



Devotional Poems of Miri Bil 


85 


But I have blurred the lines on my fingers 
Counting the days 
I have fallen yellow, my Dearest, 

On account of the absence of the Beloved, 

A strange livery for a girl m her youth 
Servant Mira, havmg worshipped Krishna, 

Has offered Him her body and mind 

118 

How long have I been standmg 
Waiting expectantly and ready for service? 
Deign to vouchsafe me a glance, 

0 Friend of the Afflicted 

My relatives have turned against me 
And find my conduct offensive 

1 have no one to call my own 
But thee 

My boat has shuddered*!®^ in mid-sea 
And IS now at a standstill 
No peace by day, no sleep by mght 
I stand ever in expiectation. 

And am withering away 

The arrow of “absence” has pierced my heart. 
And I cannot forget Thee for a moment 
You saved Ahaly^, turned to stone. 

When you found her m the woods 
Is It such a burden to raise Mira, 

Scarcely a tenth of her weight 

119 

Come to my house, stranger t 
Bodily pain will go, joy will dawn 
Let us sing hymns together! 

The peacock has heard the thunder 
And is dancing in ecstasy ! 

Come to my courtyard nowt 
The lotus expands 



84 


Devotional Poraas of Mira Bai 


And great will be my joy, too. 

When I can see Thee 
O my companion, I will feel cool 
To the very pores of my skin 
Come to my courtyard, Mohan 
O Support of Thy Bhaktas, 

Do not neglect Thy promise to me, 
Mira is desolate, O courtly Giridhara! 
Come to her. 

And end her strife and pain. 


120 

Come to my house and talk to me, 

0 Shyam 

1 shall be filled with joy and vigour. 
And will offer myself, mind and body. 
I am Thy loyal servant. 

Pray do not forget it 
The sky emits thunder 
And the clouds bring ram. 

On hearing the cuckoo’s call 
The abandoned one, too. 

Cries out for her lover 
Come to my house, Shyam, 

I remain ever attached to Thy feet 
Take Mira into Thy protection 
She offers herself as a sacrifice. 

Accept her as such 


Rays of Hope 
121 

Today I heard to my great delight 

That Han had come 

Seeing that He has in fact not come, 

I gaze down the road with yearning 
My eyes will not obey my commands 



[>eTotioiial Poems of ACra Bal 


85 


And emit a constant flow of tears 
What can I do? 

I am at a perfect loss 
I have not wings to fly 

Says Mira O my Master, the courtly Giridhara, 
I await Your coming m great expectation 

122 


The rainy season is abroad 
And the skirt of my dress is wet 
You have gone off to distant lands. 
And my heart finds it unbearable 
I keep sending letters to my Beloved 
Asking when He will return 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
O Krishna, O Brother of Balram, 
Grant me Thy sight 


123 


I send letters to my Beloved, 

The dear Krishna 

But He sends no message of reply. 

Purposely preserving silence 

I sweep His path in readiness 

And gaze and gaze 

Till my eyes turn blood-shot 

I have no peace by night or day. 

My heart is fit to break 
O my Master, You were my companion 
In former births 
When will You come? 


124 

Come to my house, O beautiful Shyam 
Without You I have no joy. 

And have turned yellow as an autumn leaf 
I place faith in nothing else, 

O my Master,

Derofioiial Poems of Mira Bai 


Except m contemplation of ThTO 
May the Lord of Mira come quickly 
And spare her further shame 


125 

0 Govmd, for a loving friend. 

Thy ways are devious indeed i*® 

1 stand waitmg for Him at the door. 
And sweep the path 

And thus my mind gams peace 
Only Thou knowest my heart. 

And hence I breathe freely 
Mira’s Lord is Han, the Indestructible, 
Whom she loved in a former birth 
Come, my Beloved, 

In Thy absence I can no longer sleep 
I am gazing down Thy path 
Come, lovely Shyam, tbe Indestructible, 
I enjoy no comfort. 

And my heart is sorely distressed 
For Thy sake have I given up all 
Food and drink do not please me 
O Lord of Mira, Mira begs for darshan 
Hear her prayer 


127 


O Gopal, 

Now I have developed true love 
For Thy holy feet 
When my love began. 

No one knew of it. 

But now It IS an open secret 
Show compassion and grant me Thy sight. 
Think of Thy servant this instant 
Says Mira, O my Lord, 

0 courtly Gindhara, 

1 offer myself wholly at Thy lotus feet 



Devotional Poems of Mira Biu 


128 

My love has gone to those holy feet 
Without Thy sight, nothing pleases 
The world is a deceit and a delusion. 

Or simply a dream 

My fear of the ocean of transmigration. 

And all my worldly relationships. 

Have I cast at Han’s feet 

Mira says O my Lord, my courtly Giridhara, 
All my hopes he in taking refuge with Thee 

129 

0 Krishna, grant unto my love 
Its due reward 

You are for me an ocean of virtues. 

Regard not my defects 

The people of the world rate me. 

But my heart pays no attention 
Come and speak a sweet word to me 
With Thine own lips 

1 have been Thy servant for many bitths. 
Come to my courtyard, I beg Thee 

Says Mira O my Lord, the courtly Giridhara, 
Lead my raft to the further shore 

130 

Come to meet me, my Proud One, 

I have fallen in love 

With Thy beauteous form 

Enquire my name I am known 

As she whom “absence” drove to madness 

I enjoy peace neither by day nor night. 

Like a fish separated from water 
Without Thy sight I can enjoy nothing 
And am dying in writhing agony 
Mira is the servant of Thy feet 
Hear her pra>er, O Beneficent One ’

DevotMMUil Poems of Mira Bai 


The Lord 
131 

Who but Thee will take notice of me, 

O Gindhara, Holder of the Mountain 
Thy crown of peacock-plumes 
And Thy yellow waist-band are most becoming 
Strange is the beauty of Thy large ear-rings 

0 Muran, Thou didst protect the modesty 
Of the daughter of Drupadi24 

In the midst of the packed assembly 

Says Mira, O my Master, the courtly Gindhara, 

1 offer myself as a sacrifice at Thy feet 

132 

0 Han ’ Hear my petition, my King 

1 am a weak girl, my Lord, 

Protect my reputation 
Wherever I go 1 am Thine 

Han has become the ornament of my heart 
Assuming the body of a horse, 

You slew the Daityas 

And fulfilled the purposes of the gods 

Mira has no other Lord but Thee, 

Thou art the crest-jewel on my head 

133 

I have taken refuge in Thee, O Krishna, 

Save me in any way Thou wilt 
I have returned fruitless 

From visiting the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage, 
But my mind will not accept defeat 

0 Muran, harken when I tell Thee 
That in this world 

1 have none to call my own 

Servant Mira places her faith in Krishna 
Release her from the snar? called “the world"

134 

O Gindhara, I have taken refuge in Thee 
Protect me, O Ocean of Mercy ’ 

You saved the sinner Ajamil.^®® 

And the low-cast Sadana 

You saved the elephant when he was drowning,^*® 
You mounted the courtesan on a chariot 
You have saved many other low creatures, 

As the holy men relate O Gindhara, 

You saved the wild woman of the woods 
And also the hunch-back woman,^®® 

As all the world knows 
Thy virtues are past all telling, 

Even the Vedas and Puraijias are taxed 
Says Mira Lord, my refuge is m Thee, 

Harken to my prayer 


135 

My Lord, I am offering a petition 
Take my raft to the further shore 
I have suffered much in this world. 
Remove my doubts and afflictions 
The eight worldly pre-occupations^®® 
Have set in Oh, remove my pain 
The world is a flowing stream 
Comprising eighty-four lakhs of births 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
May He end this coming and going 
Once and for all 


136 


0 Storehouse of Compassion, 

Lend Your ear to my prayer 

1 love the holy hymns proclaiming Your glory. 
But my life-breath ails 

I have no true relative or friend. 

The whole world has turned against me i®*

Devotional Poems of Mira Bm 


You saved the elephant bitten by a crocodile, 
Redeeming Your pledge 
Servant Mira makes humble petition 
That she has no other support but Thee 

137 

Han, I have heard that You save sinners. 
And rescue them from the miseries 
Of worldly existence 

You came running when You heard the cry 

Of the drowning elephant 

You remove the afflictions of Your devotees 

You lengthened the dress 

Of the daughter of Drupad, 

Humbling the pride of Duhshasan 
You kept Your promise to Prahlad, 

Teanng open the belly of Hirapyakashipu 
The wife of the rishi^®® received Y our grace 
You removed the sufferings 
Of the Brahmin Sudama 
Says Mira My Lord, 

You know my request 
Why delay any further‘d 


138 

Shy^, now You have taken my arm’ 
Drowning m the ocean of transmigration, 

I have taken refuge in You 
My defects are innumerable. 

Who but You could tolerate me‘> 

Says Mira O my Lord, Han the Indestructible, 
Do not allow Your reputations^® to falter 

139 

O Shyam, O Govind, do not depart 
From the orbit of my sight 
You sent the ox to the house of Kabir,s*o 
You mended N5m Dev’s roof,s^i 



DeTotional Poems of Mbri Bai 


You sowed Your servant Dhanna’s field, 

You heard the elephant’s cry 
You ate the forest-woman’s plums^** 

And Sudama’s handful of nee i*® 

You accepted Karama Bai’s dish,!*® 

And took it with joy 

Shyam shines forth amidst a thousand Gopis 

Like the moon amidst the stars 

You fulfilled the needs of all Your saints. 

But from Mira You remain aloof 

140 

0 my Beloved, I have felt the attraction 
Of the holy Name I have heard 

That those who take the Name are saved, 

The whole rock-hard world melts to water 

1 hive earned no merit 

And have amassed much demerit through sin 

The courtesan who taught her parrot 

To repeat the holy Name 

Was transported to the heaven of Vishnu 

The elephant only half-pronounced Your Name, 

Yet all his troubles came to an end 
Descending from Garuda, You came running on foot. 
And all his re-birth in animal wombs 
Came to an end 

You exempted Ajamil!*® from his sms 
And his fear of death melted away 
He sang the holy Name 
Simply by calling for his son. 

This the whole world knows 
You recognize faith when you see it. 

And grant boons to those who seek refuge 
With a pure heart 
Mira is Your servant. 

Accept her as Your own*

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Faith 

141 


Now my faith is strong. 

Weak woman though I be 

The beautiful Shyam has come to my house 

I already have Han for my necklace, 

I will have Him for my ear-rings too. 

Him, my bnde-groom, Vitthal Nath 
My crest-jewel is the Four-Armed Vishnu, 
Whose image revolves in my mind — 

I need not go to a goldsmith 
My anklets are composed 
Of Him who IS the Life of the Universe 
Krishna is my arm-band. 

And my foot-band too 
My foot-rings and dancer’s anklets 
Are Rama Narayana,“* 

The nng on my big toe, the Inner Ruler 
I will have a casket aflSxed to my belt, 

Made from the Supreme Spirit,^^ 

A lock from the Name of Tnvikram,i®* 

A key from Him whose Joy is compassion 

There will I keep my treasures safe 

Now I am seated in the bnde-groom’s house. 

Arrayed in finery and quite without shame 

Says Mira O my Master, the courtly Giridhara, 

Henceforth I will address my petitions 

To the feet of Hari 


142 

Shr! Krishna has entered my heart 

And the clouds have filled the sky 

Thunder roars, clouds quake 

And the flashes of lightning inspire terror 

Cloud-banks mount as the east wind blows 

Frogs croak, the cuckoo sings. 

And the cry of the jieacock is heard

Expectation 

143 

I have heard that today Han will come 

0 my companion, 

1 will climb my high palace 

To see when my King will come 
Frogs, peacocks and papihas are calling. 

The koil IS striking its plaintive note 
Indrai®^ is exulting, rain is falling everywhere. 
The lightning is dancing without shame 
The earth robes herself anew 
To greet Indra 

Says Mira, O my Master, the courtly Gindhara* 
Come quickly, my King 


Meeting the Beloved 
144 


I offer a thousand thanks 

To the astrologer who predicted Shyam would come 
My joy IS overflowing, my soul has access 
To an incalculable storehouse of joy 
I meet with my companions^®* 

To honour and please the Beloved, 

And there is joy all round 
O My dear compamon. 

Now that I have seen the Lord, 

All my desires are fulfilled 

And my suffermgs forgotten 

Shyam, the Ocean of Joy, Mira’s Lord, 

Has entered her home 



94 


Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


145 

O Shyam, today I have observed 
The colourful ceremony of Gauri Puja 
Lightning flashes in black and coppery clouds 
As the storm collects 

Frogs, peacocks and cuckoos are in full voice, 

The koil IS singing loudly 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

She stakes all on His holy feet 

146 

Here are the clouds of the rainy season. 

The rainy season so dear to the heart 
My heart overflows with delight 
This rainy season, 

As I have heard that Han will come 
Thick and threatening clouds have collected. 

The lightning brings with it steady ram 

Now the lightning is accompanied by light drops 

And a delightful cool breeze 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 

This IS the time for auspicious hymns 

147 

Come to my house, my Shyam, 

For the rainy season fills me with emotion 
The clouds have collected from all quarters 
And the thunder is roaring 
Frogs, peacocks and cuckoos cry out. 

And the koil sings lustily 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 

What she can offer is small 


148 

Myself dyed deep with love and emotion, 
I am playing Holi^-®® with Shyam 
The red powder is flying. 



Devotioosl Poems of IVGrI Bai 


95 


The very clouds are red in the sky 

I am pumping out jets of coloured water 

With the help of a squirt 

My pot IS full of saffron 

And various fragrant unguents 

Mira is the servant of the courtly Giridhara, 

She IS lying, handmaid, at His feet 

149 

Come cloud, fill Thyself with water and come 

0 my companion. 

The raindrops are falling. 

Just listen to the koil’s cry 
A sweet breeze is playing 
To the music of thunder. 

And the sky is overcast with clouds 
Today the Beloved will come to my house 

1 have prepared a bed for Him, 

And you, O my companions. 

Will sing Him songs of welcome 

Says Mira O Han, O Indestructible One, 
Fortunate indeed are those who attain Thy side 

150 

The Beloved has come to my house 
After many an age of expectation. 

The abandoned one has found her Lover 
I am offering Him jewels as a present 
And performing the Arti in His honour 
The Beloved is compassionate 
And sent me a message 
My darkling Beloved has come. 

Every limb m my body throbs with joy 
My love is for that ocean of love, Han 
His love has entrapped my eyes 
Says Mira He is joy abundant, 

I have enthroned Him on my brow

DevotionI Poems of Mira Bal 


151 

Come to my pavilion, O my King 
I have spread a bed 

Made of delicately selected buds and blossoms. 
And have arrayed myself in bridal garb 
From head to toe 

I have been Thy slave during many births. 
Thou art the be-all of my existence.^®* 

Mira’s Lord is Han, the IndeStructible 
Come, grant me Thy sight at once 

152 

I am deeply attached to Thy beauty, 

O Lover of Radha, O Great King 
Robed m saffron. 

He wears a jewel-studded crown 

With a peacock plume 

With His alligator-earrings 

And peacock -plume crown 

He IS the very picture of refinement 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 

She says Today I have met my King 


Self-Dedication 

153 

Go to the place where the Beloved abides, 
Go to the place where you may find Him 
If the Beloved tells me, 

I will put on a red san, 

If he tells me, 

I will don the ochre robe 
I will decorate my hair-parting with pearls 
Or leave my scattered locks unkempt. 

Either according to His wish 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 

She says Harken to the praises of my King. 



Devotional Poems of IVCra Bsu 


154 

0 Gmdhara Lai, keep me as Thy servant 
Keep me as Thy servant 

1 will remain Thy faithful servant. 

Will plant Thy garden. 

And every morning will rise early 
To have Thy sight 
In the leafy lanes of Bnndavan 
I will sing the deeds of Govind 
If I perform Thy service, 

I will have Thy sight for reward 
Thy remembrance will be my wages. 

The spirit of devotion my fief. 

For which I have longed during many a birth 
Beautiful is Krishna with His peacock crown. 
His Yellow waist-cloth 
And His glittering necklace of gems 
Mohan, the flute-player. 

Is grazing the cows in Bnndavan 
I will make fresh green bowers for Him, 
With borders between 
Robed m a scarlet sari, 

I shall enjoy the sight of Shyam, 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gmdhara, 

Her heart is in much perturbation 
I request to have sight of the Lord 
At midnight by the banks of the Yamuni 

155 

O my companion, 

Shyam shot an arrow 

That has pierced me through 

The fire of longing 

Is burning m my heart 

And my whole body is in torment 

My roving mind cannot stir. 

Fettered in the chains of love 
No one but myself and my Beloved

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Knows the extent of my pain 
I can do nothing, my companion. 

But weep copious tears 

Mira says, “My Lord, unless you come 

My life cannot endure ” 


The World 
156 


O my companion. 

Without Shyam I suffer greatly Without Him, 
Who can give me strength to endure 
The world is a hissing cauldron of error 
It takes no joy 

In cultivating the society of the good 

They abuse the holy men 

While themselves earning demerit 

By their wicked deeds 

Without the Name of God 

One does not gam liberation. 

One merely circulates 

In the eighty-four lakhs of wombs 

The fools waste their precious lives. 

Not seeking the society of the good 
Even in a dream 

Mira says My Lord, I take refuge m Thee 

Thus will I attain 

The highest state open to man 

157 


The jjeople of the world 

Would die of shame 

To be caught taking the Name of God 

They will tramp round the whole village. 

But feel too fatigued 

To visit the temple of Han 



Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


99 


If a quarrel arises 
They run to it at once. 

Leaving what they are doing in the house 
To hear a buffoon crack jests. 

Or to watch a courtesan dance. 

They will sit twelve hours at a stretch 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara 
She has taken refuge at His lotus feet 

158 

You cannot call this true devotion. 

To bathe one’s forehead and apply the tilak 
Without cleansing the impurities of the heart 
That cruel cur desire 
Has bound me with the cord of greed 
The butcher of anger remains within me. 

How can I hope to meet GopaP 
The greedy senses are like a cat. 

And I keep on giving them food 
Weakened by my hunger for sense-objects 
I do not take the Name of God 
I worship not God but myself. 

And glow with ecstasy 
Now that I have built up 
This towering rock of pride. 

Where can the water of true wisdom collect*^!^*® 

You cannot deceive Him who knows 

The inmost recesses of your soul 

The Name of Han does not enter my heart. 

Though I tell with my lips 

The beads of my bejewelled rosary 

Learn to love the compassionate Lord, 

Give up faith in the world 

Mira is the slave of the courtly Gindhara, 

She has adopted the path of simple detachment 

159 

How can one come to meet the Lord'> 

For fifteen hours one is busy.

Harken to the clink of their bracelets 
Wake up, Lalji, the dawn has come.

Devotional Poems of Mira 


I had gone to the Yamuna 
To fetch water. 

When along came Krishna Muran 
The little monkey stole my sari. 

And I was left standing naked 
In the water 

‘ My companions all laughed 

And clapped their hands to see my plight 
My mother-in law is ill-natured. 

My sister-in-law morose. 

They quarrel with me and abuse me

Murari gave my sari a twitch 

The pot of dye I was carrying 

Fell from my head 

My nose-ring slipped oft 

And got caught in my sari 

My hair broke loose 

And became entangled in my ear-rings. 

The tip of my sari was tom 
The Charmer of Hearts was in wanton mood.

Gindhara is playing Holi 

He plays to perfection 

The flute, the lute and the drums. 

Along with his companions, the women of Braj 

Mohan Bihari scatters with His own hand 

The sandalwood and saffron 

In large handfuls He flings the red powder 

In all directions 

And it falls on everyone 

There is the handsome youth Krishna, 

And with Him is Radha, 

Dear to Him as His life 
He sings the apprporiate songs for Holi, 
Clapping exquisitely in time with the music 
That great artist Shyam is playing Holi, 

And all Braj is flooded with joy 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

Is Mohan Lai, “The Stroller in the Woods”

Where are You taking me, Krishna*? 

In the lanes and bowers of Bnndaban, 
He has taken me by the hand 
He ate my curds and broke the pot 
And took me in His arms 
He jumped at me. 

And dashed my pot to the ground. 

That dark figure with the beautiful limbs 
O Mohan, 

You came and went freely in Gokul, 

But would never accept my curds

Shyam has stalked off to pumsh me 
And IS frolickmg about with other women 
He will not even speak to me 
He will not even come into my lane. 

But steps into the courtyards of others 
He will not even touch my finger. 

But twists the arms of others 
He will not touch my shawl. 

But He lifts the veil of others 
Shyam is Mira’s Lord, 

But He wanders about hke a rake 


O my companion. 

My modesty was my enemy 
Why did I not go off 
With Shri Lai GopaP

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


The cruel Akrur^'^® came in a decorated chariot 
He seated Gopal on the chariot 
And drove off. 

Leaving me wringing my hands 
My heart must be of steel 
Not to break Shyam left me. 

And now my whole body 
Is burning with the pam of longing 
Mira is the slave of Lai Giridhara, 

Why IS she not already dead and scattered*^ 


Conversation With TJddhava 
183 

O Uddhava,!®® it is all the fault 

Of our own Karma 

It is useless to blame others 

0 Harken, my companions. 

It was while walking on the path 
That I suffered the blow 
At first I did not understand,!®^ 

1 had chosen the road of!*® egoism 

I did not think Han would leave me. 

But our good and evil fortune 
Is written by the finger of fate 
Mira’s Lord is Hari, toe Indestructible 
Come, Lord, remove her pam 

184 

The impulse comes into my mind 

To rove about in company with Gopal 

When I beheld the beauty 

Of His lotus face 

I lost control of my faculties 

Let me take flute and staff in hand 

And don a yellow loin-cloth 

Let me rove about with the herds.

Clad like a herdsman 

And wearing a peacock-plume crown 

See, I have become a lovely creeper 

Gracing the Bnndaban nights 

I see the beasts and birds and monkeys 

And hear the discourses of the sages 

The elders have laid down 

A narrow code of conventional behaviour 

To whom can I open my heart‘d 

O Mira, find the Lord Gindhara 

And continue your life like this 

185 

O Uddhav, who will read this letter 
In the absence of the Lord, 

Who will read it*^!®* 

You came with this piece of paper. 

But where did you leave your Comrade‘s 

Our feet are worn with walking 

And our eyes have turned bloodshot 

Radha took the letter 

And sat reading it 

Her heart overflowed 

Water streamed from her lotus eyes 

Like the mighty flow of the Ganges 

She turned yellow like an autumn leaf. 

And would not touch food 

In the absence of Han, 

Her heart was burning 
Like the wick of a lamp 
My faith is m Krishna^®® 

Who saved the drowning elephant 
Mira is the slave of Lai Gindhara, 

Her companion on a narrow path

The wild woman of the woods^®® 

Found out the sweet plums by tasting them 

And brought them to the Lord 

She was neither cmlized nor educated 

Nor possessed of physical beauty 

She was of low caste and filthy apparel. 

But the Lord accepted her soiled plums. 
Knowing the smcenty of her love 
She recognized no distmctions of high and low. 
But sou^t only the pure milk of love 
Not for her the leanung of the Veda, 

She was transported to heaven on a chariot 

At a single stroke 

Now she sports in Vaikunth,i»’ 

Bound to Han by ties of love 

Says servant Mira 

Whoso loves like this is saved 

The Lord is the Saviour of the Fallen 

And I was a cowherd-maiden at Gokul 

In a former birth

Devotional Poems of Mira Bai 


Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
He changed the poison to nectar 

190 

Strange are the decrees of fate 
Behold the large eyes of the deer’ 

Yet he is forced to roam the forests 
The harsh crane has brilliant plumage. 
While the sweet-voiced cuckoo is black 
The rivers flow in pure streams. 

But the sea makes them salt 
Fools sit on thrones as kings. 

While the wise beg their bread 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
The King persecutes the Bhaktas 

191 

Do not mention the name of love, 

O my simple-minded companion 

Strange is the path 

When you offer your love 

Your body is crushed at the first step 

If you want to offer love 

Be prepared to cut off your head 

And sit on it 

Be like the moth. 

Which circles the lamp and offers its body 
Be like the deer which on hearing the horn 
Offers Its head to the hunter 
Be like the partridge. 

Which swallows burning coals 
In love of the moon 
Be like the fish. 

Which yields up its life 
When separated from the sea 
Be like the bee.

Entrapped m the closing petals of the lotus 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara 
She says Offer your mind 
To those lotus feet 


192 

Only he knows the bitterness of love 
Who has deeply felt its pangs 
When you are in trouble 
No one comes near you 
When fortune smiles. 

All come to share the joy 
Love shows no external wound. 

But the pain pervades every pore 
Devotee Mira offers her body 
As a sacrifice to Gindhara for ever 

193 

Go to that impenetrable realm 

That Death himself trembles to look upon 

There plays the fountain of love 

With swans sporting on its waters 

There the company of holy men is available. 

And one may talk of spiritual knowledge i*® 

There one can meditate on Shyam 

And purify one’s mind 

There one may bind on 

The anklets of good-conduct. 

And dance the dance of inner contentment 
There one may adopt a headpiece of gold 
And the sixteen kinds of adornment 
Let there be love for Shyam 
And indifference to all else

Take no pride in the body. 

It will soon be mingling with the dust 
This life IS like the sporting of sparrows 
It will end with the onset of night 
Why don the ochre robe 
A.nd leave home as a sannyasi'^ 

Those who adopt the external garb of a Jogi

We do not get a human life 
Just for the asking 
Birth in a human body 
Is the reward for good deeds 
In former births 

Life waxes and wanes imperceptibly. 

It does not stay long 
The leaf that has once fallen 
Does not return to the branch 
Behold the Ocean of Transmigration, 

With Its swift, irresistible tide 
O Lai Giridhara, O pilot of my soul. 

Swiftly conduct my barque to the further shore 

Mira is the slave of Lai Giridhara 

She says Life lasts but a few days only 

197 


Life in the world is short. 

Why shoulder an unnecessary load 
Of worldly relationships'^ 

Thy parents gave thee birth in the world. 
But the Lord ordained thy fate 
Life passes in getting and spending. 

No merit is earned by virtuous deeds 
I will sing the praises of Han 
In the company of holy men. 

Nothing else concerns me 
Mira’s Lord is the courtly Giridhara, 
She says Only by Thy power 
Have I crossed to the further shore 

198 

Do not forget thy duty to serve, 

O servant 

Thy joys are of short duration,

O my mind. 

Drink the nectar of the Name of God ^oo 
Drink the nectar of the Name of God 
Give up evil company. 

And continually keep the company 
Of holy men 

Listen to the accounts of Han 

That proceed from their lips 

Expel lust, anger, pride, greed and infatuation 

From thy mind 

Mira’s Lord is the courtly Gindhara, 

She IS soaked in His love

0 my mind, 

1 repeat continually the Name of Shyam 

0 ye living creatures. 

Through repeating the Name of Shyam 

1 have absolved a million sms 
The Name of Shyam has destroyed

In a golden cup. 

Who could refuse to drink it*^

She IS dissolved in Shyam,

Waves over His head like a royal parasol. 

The beauty of His ear-rings

While the Gomati River flows on nearby 
Flags on poles adorn its banks. 

Festooned with swaying strings of pearls 2®* 
Our Lord and Master Ranachor

Prahlada was the son of Hirapyakasipu, king of the demons Persecuted 
by his father, Prahlada remained constant m devotion to Visnu One day his 
father asked him, “Where is your God Prahlada replied, “He is every- 
where, even in this pillar ” Hirapyakasipu kicked the pillar with his foot,

As long as the soul remains bereft of the grace of God, it continues to act 
with egoism and attachment, and such action forces it to return to earth m a 
new body to experience the ‘Truits” or moral deserts of that action Thus the 
soul becomes involved in continual rebirth m new bodies, exposed to the 
certainty of suffering, disease and death As this process is self-perpetuating 
and inevitable until the soul is rescued by the grace of the Lord, it is called an 
'unnavigable sea” and He the 'raft

incarnations, they axe attributed by Mira personally to l§yama. Poem 139 
Except at Poem 186, no scenes from the life of Rama son of Daiaratha are 
depicted Admittedly the word “Rama” was used by the Sant poets, to whom 
Mira owes some degree of allegiance, quite generally in the sense of “God” 
But a particularly clear instance of the use of “Rtoia” to mean “Krspa” is 
recorded at Note 58, Poem 55 

31 

See Note 16 

32 

There are other versions of this famous poem m which the reference to 
miraculous delivery from the effects of poison does not occur, and one cannot 
but suspect that the line is an interpolation If it is taken as genuine, it would 
have to be presumed that the whole poem was composed after Mira had 
left Mewar, and that the reference was to an attempt made on her life by 
Vikramajita Siipha, her borther-in-law See the account of her life in the 
Introduction and Note 41 below 

33 

The reference to a miraculous escape from a black serpent concealea 
in a basket is less well attested m the early hagiographical literature than the 
attempted poisomng (Padmavati, p 85) One must assume that if the poem 
IS accepted as authentic, the line must be an interpolation 
33a 

The mystics join hands down the ages and all across continents Acarya 
Caturvedi very appositely compares this poem with the “Man az *alam tu 
ra tanha guzmam” of Jal^ uddin ROmi, which is translated in R A 
Nicholson, “Divani Shamsi Tabriz”, Cambridge 1898 (reprinted 1952) p 121

miraculous deliverances from attempts made by him on Mira*s life The 
earliest surviving biographical notice, that of the Bhakta-Mala of Nabha 
D^sa, mentions an unsuccessful attempt on Mira’s life by poisoning This 
seems credible enough, given the times in which she lived But as there is a 
tradition in Dvaraka that Mira was successfully poisoned in Cittaur 
(Padmavati, p 60), and as similar traditions are circulated about Goda, 
Mira’s counterpart among the Tamil Alvars, one has to reckon with the 
possibility that even the earliest and simplest form of the tradition was no 
more than a rumour, eagerly accepted and spres^d to glorify the saint The 
later biographical literature appears to build on this first account and embel- 
lish It Fresh accounts of other escapes from death appear, m which the 
miraculous element is further accentuated The poems that refer to these 
“events” are suspect m style as well as in content (Padmavati, p 85, p 176 
Goetz, p 42 Caturvedi, p 6, p 22 D S Bhati, p 237) For the context 
in which these poems are today usually understood when taken as genuine, 
see Note 32

The reference is probably to sects who practised woman-worship in its 
cruder forms Banarasi Prasada SaksenS mentions the special connection of 
the RajpQts with Sakta forms of worship at Dhirendra Varma, p 37 

43 

The word “jana” may here only mean “Han jana”, devotees of Han, as 
in the last line of Poem 59 But the mention of a “narrow path” may imply 
that the reference is to the Guru Kabir speaks of the spiritual path as being 
“narrow ’ because there is not room for two on it The pupil has to dissolve 
his individuality in that of the Guru

In this poem, Mira seems to be reflecting on the difiiculties of spiritual 
love First she reflects that to His devotees the Lord appears like a tease, 
first granting His love and then withdrawing it Then she seems to reflect 
despairingly on her insufficiencies, on the disparity between herself and her 
Lord and on her own presumption Finally the despair melts away with the 
dawning of an ecstatic mood, symbolized by the features of the natural scene

More literally “Not the one who loses it ” The exact hieaning of the 
line seems uncertain, but it has been taken as a bitter reproach to the Lord 

81 

The commentators differ over the meaning of the jfinal sentence. 

82 

Babul = baba = father According to the generally accepted view of Mira’s 
life, she saw little of her father when she was grown up Unless it were to be 
taken as a memory of her early childhood, the reference would apparently 
either have to be to DClda ji, Rana Sanga or Viram Deva It is a most awkward 
line Could it be a merely imagined situation

The cataka bird (Indian cuckoo) is fabled to drink only that water which 
has fallen when the moon is in the constellation of Sviti and to spurn all 
other water 

85 

Reading piva piva for pila with Sasi PrabhS The bird’s natural call is 
taken to be a repetition of the word “piva” meaning ‘Belovea” or “Darling’ 
as she waits faithfully for her “lover”, the rain-cloud that appears at the time 
when the moon is passing through the constellation of SvSti This call to the 
Beloved reminds MirS agonizingly of her absent Lord

The authorities are not agreed on the exact meaning of the last phrase

Holi IS the well-known spring festival in which the Hindus of northern

A little earlier than Mira, the Bangah Kisna-poet Candidasa attributed 
a similar belief in crows as a good omen of the coming of the Beloved to 
Radha Cp H P Dvivedi, Madhya-Kalina Dharma-Sadhana p 193 The 
tradiponal belief was that the appearance of a crow portended the arrival of 
the Beloved, but that the abandoned one must say to the crow, "‘Go a\va>, 
my beloved is coming ” (D S Bhati)

The commentators are not agreed over this obscure line 

115 

&sa IS the serpent with a thousand heads who forms the couch and 
canopy for Visnu when the latter is at rest between successive world-periods 
As he has a thousand heads he also has a thousand tongues and is conse- 
quently very eloquent and very wise Siva and Sesa in their own very different 
ways are both emblems of wisdom Yet Mira s Jogi (Krsna) is so supremely 
wise that even J§iva and Sesa are happy to meditate on Him, for inspiration 

116

According to the Vaisnava traditions, the demons called Daityas stole the 
Vedas from the gods at the beginning of the world-period and Visnu assumed 
the form of a horse (haya) or horse-necked creature (haya-griva) and slew 
the Daityas and recovered the Vedas for the benefit of the gods There are 
various forms of the legend

A list of names is given by Y Sarma and T Tandan m their tika But the 
line need not necessarily be taken as evidence that Mira visited distant parts 
of South India It could well be just a vague indication that she visited many 
places of pilgrimage, or even a mere assertion that even if she had done so 
she would have returned empty The phrase occurs also in Poem 30 

128 

Ajamila was a fallen Brahmin whose sins were erased and who was trans- 
ported to the abode of Visnu simply because he called for his son on his death- 
bed and his son’s name happened to be Narayana Such is the power of the 
holy Name of God 

129 

Sadana was a dc\otee of Visnu who plied the (in a Hindus eyes) degrading 
trade of a butcher It happened that one of the weights he used came from 
the Salagrama stone (see Note 50) A holy man recognized it and took it 
away to worship it, but was instructed in a dream to return it When Sadana 
heard of this, he gave up his trade and went to Bhuvane^vara as a wandering 
beggai Eventually he obtained release His case is often cited by the 
Bhaktas to show that it is internal piety and goodness that coi nt in attracting 
the grace of the Lord and not the external circumstances

The courtesan Jivanti lacked a child and acquired a pet parrot as a 
substitute She taught it to say the Name of God ‘ Rama’ , and together 
they would repeat it At her death she and the parrot were transported by 
aerial chariot to the realm of Visnu Such is the purifying effect of the 
repetition of the Name of God

Some of the commentators enumerate the eight “bonds” mentioned in the 
Kularnava Tantra, hatred, shame, fear, doubt, disgust, family-convention, 
individual disposition and caste-custom The list fits the context, but one

Sudama, Krsna’s boyhood friend, fell upon evil days in later life, and 
went to see Krsna, taking as a present a few grams of rice that his wife had 
managed to save with the greatest difficulty Kysna accepted the gift joyously 
and later heaped great wealth on Sudama 

140 

According to tradition, Kabir, the renowned mystic, gave away all the 
cloth he had woven in the bazaar, down to the very clothes he was wearing, 
and did not dare to go back home to his family naked and empty-handed 
But the Lord assumed the form of a nch merchant and took an ox laden 
with provisions to Kabir’s home 

141 

It is said that the house of the saint Ntaia Deva caught fire As the saint 
worshipped God in everything, he took the opportunity to worship Him in 
the fire, into which he made an offering of his other belongings * The Lord, 
pleased with this resignation, personally attended to the mending of the saint’s 
roof that night 

142 

The saint Dhanna was a farmer One day he set off to plough but gave

Karama Bai lived m Jagamiatha Pun and offered the Lord milk and rice 
with devotion Eventually He assumed the form of a child and came to eat 
It in her house A holy man informed Karam§. Bai that she was not observ- 
ing the proper ritual before cookmg The next day she was late with 
the milk and nee as she had been busy with the ritual When the pnests threw 
open the temple gates that morning they saw the remains of food round the 
lips of the image The deity explamed by means of a voice from the sky 
that Karama Bai was late with the food and He had had to hurry eating it 
The point of the tradition is that the Lord cares more for offenngs made with 
a loving heart than for meticulous performance of ritual 

147 

The commentators are divided over the meaning of this obscure phrase 
I follow Y Sarma and T Tandan, who agree with Sasi Prabha in taking 
pani to mean water If pani meant prani (as it does for K D Sarma and 
D S Bhati) the meaning would be something like “The whole world is saved, 
from stones (like Ahilya) to livmg creatures ” This interpretation, though 
not here adopted, is defensible Cp Tulasidasa, Vinaya Patnka 257, p^ana, 
pasu, patanga, kola, bhila, nisicara/katpca te krpanidhana kiye subarana

Vifthala Natha is now usually held to have been originally a local deity, 
who came to be worshipped as Krspa m company with His spouse Rukmmi 
m the temple of Pandharpur, some 200 miles south-east of Bombay Already 
some centuries before Mira’s birth, the devotees of Vitthala Natha constituted 
a pious sect of Visnu-worshippers Great Teachers had already appeared, 
such as the author of the famous Jnane§vari Commentary on the Gita, and 
Nama Deva, who has already been mentioned in Poem 139 (see Note 141) 
The latter appears to have travelled north and composed some hymns m 
Hindi as well as the hymns in his native Marathi The teachings of this school 
were broadly similar to those of Mira, so there is no incongruity m finding a 
reference to Vitthala Natha in her works What distinguishes Mirabai from 
the Krsna poets of other schools and unites her with that of Jnanesvara is 
her refusal to draw any firm distinction between worship of the Lord with 
form and worship of the formless P Caturvedi, Bhakti Sahitya mem 
Madhuropasana, p 82 K D iSarma (p 17) is surely right to remark that 
the reference is not to Vitthala, the Guru of Raidasa’s school

The translator is unsure of the meaning of citta-mala It has been taken

Names of Visnu, who is nevertheless predominantly conceived as Ki sna

Another name foi* Visnu, referiing to the fact that He bestrode the uni- 
verse in three strides 

156 

Literally, There is no under-garment ” A perplexing phrase because,. 

1 taken literally, it seems to conflict with the first half of the sentence I follow 
Sarma and T Tandan in softening and generalizing the meaning Mira 

o ers herself mind, body and soul to Krsna as a bride offers herself to her 
husband 

157 

Indra is Jupiter Pluvius, the god of rain 

158 

The commentators take the ‘‘five companions ’ of the text as the five 
senses But the term “five” was also used to mean “some’ , and the literal 
meaning of sakhyarp seems to yield the better sense Compare Poem 174 
below, and also Tulasid^as Rama Carita M^asa IIxxivl, mill dasa 
pamca rama pahim jahim

The rite is associated with thoughts of the husband “Maidens worship

Literally, “Either my dearest Beloved knows my pain or else I do ”

K D Sarma very appositely quotes from Kabir’s Granthavali, Doha 
section, Nigunam kau anga, “Kabir hari rasa barakhiya etc “Water 
collects in low ground, not on mountain-tops ” The quotation supports 
Dr Sarma’s contention that the present poem was composed under the 
influence of Sant teaching 

166 

Kara=kara liya (Sa^i Prabha) The present poem is difficult to inter- 
pret There are piactically no pronouns, and the commentators are divided 
on the question whether the strictures it contains are addressed to Mira 
herself or to others In the present translation, the clearly expressed ‘me”" 
(mohim) of ‘ has bound me with the cord of greed” has been taken to 
set the tone of the whole poem This follows Y N Sarma and T Tandan- 

167

170 

Dr Sasi Prabha records baith’ as a feminine form here, according to which 
it would have to be the sa i that was “sitting on the branch of a tree,” sub- 
sequently to be removed from it by Krsna All the previous translations 
consulted, however, put Kisna Himself on the branch of the tree, which agrees 
with iSnmad Bhagavata X xxn 9 (Ramaswami Sastrulu Ed, Madras, Vol 
ir, p 1326) It seems to be a doubtful case 

171 

Reading “de mohirp tan’ m this line and “de mohim garl” in the following 
one following D S Bhati and also Y N Sarma and T Tan^an 

172 

In this and the previous poem Krsna manifests as a mischievous little 
boy But in doing so He evokes a response of such simple-hearted love 
from His devotee that He shows Himself to be a greater “rasika” and “nagara” 
than any worldly exponent of the art of love It is worth remarking that the 
following line referring to a mother-m-Iaw and a sister-in-law is very probably 
an interpolation Miia’s alleged “sister-m-law ’ Oda is a shadowy figure 
indeed, and her historical existence has apparently never been proved 
Padmavati “!§abnam’ thinks that she is a mental creation arising from the 
belief that ‘Oda’ , the shortened form of “Udayakama”, the name of Rana 
Raymal’s parricide elder borther, had a feminine termination and referred 
to a woman (Padmavati p 172 etc ) But in this context, it seems that the 



136

name of Vikramajiia s younger brother Udaya Sirpha could be invoked with 
equal cogency 

173 

Taking “hajan"’ to mean a form of chaplet or necklace as at the line 
quoted by Padmavati ‘‘Sabnam” (Padmavati, p 6, footnote 5, and p 85, 
pahiro hara hajan) The line quoted concerns Oda and can hardly be by 
Mira But it seems to provide the best clue to the meaning of ‘ hajan” in the 
present context 

174 

lerpgo^^Iuipga (!§asi Prabha) It is assumed here that this can be used as 
a feminine But the meaning seems obscure throughout the second half of 
the poem Each of the three earlier translations consulted takes it differently, 
and the general absence of pronouns helps to reduce the translator to guess- 
work I follow K D J§arma in thinking that in the first few lines Mira is 
speaking about herself, then the subject changes to Radha, and finally it 
returns to Mira herself 

175 

Gagara is probably a better reading than nagara, as the verb hati is in 
the feminine I again follow K D J§arma, as also in attributing the golden 
pot to Mira’s head and not to Kisna’s The commentators differ here, 
probably on account of the absence of pronouns 

176 

Buddhi=hos (Sasi Prabha) Cp Poem 87, last line 

177 

Gujariya, strictly a woman of the ‘ Gujar” caste, an inferior caste of 
Rajputs, but by extension a cowherd-maiden generally (Platts, p 923,

of Christ on the cross

According to the poetic convention, the partridge is so much in love with 
the moon that it swallows burning coals, mistaking them for fragments of 
the moon 
197a 

There seem to be two levels of meaning in this poem At one level Mira 
>s referring to the pure waters of the inmost core of the soul, always present 
but only to be “reached” by utter detachment from everything external, 
achieved through meditative practices (sadhanS) But the individual soul 
that has merged with the supreme Self is known m Indian spiritual tradition 
as a swan (hamsa, paramaharpsa) Cp iSveta^vatara Upanishad VI 15 
So Mira is also apparently addressing the pupil-devotee and saying “Go 
and associate with the Paramahaipsas in sat-sang on the highest plane of 
spintual detachment ” K D Sarmt and D S Bhati rightly draw attention 
to the presence of the characteristic imagery of the Sant or Nirguna tradition 
•n this poem References to the “sahaja” state of consciousness as an “inac- 
cessible place” are common to many forms of Xantnka teaching Cp Vaude- 
'^he, Kabir, p 125 As regards Kabir, see the references given in the Kabir 
Ko§a of Parasuraraa Caturvedi and Mahendra under “agama” and “haiiisa”
