# Literary-RNN
A repository for my recurrent neural network literature generation projects. My aim in these projects is to have fun exploring machine learning and literature, and I wish to make my discoveries available to anyone else who is curious! Check out the releases for updated versions of my RNNs!

Check out https://huggingface.co/spaces/oscars47/thinking_parrot_reading_club_redux to interact with Thinking Parrot, my RNN model! ðŸ¦œ
