20,"This conjures images of the Vikings, or of a land in northwestern Europe during the early Middle Ages. The tone is dramatic, and I feel the intimidation of Iamderg’s enemies. I am not scared of him myself because I feel like I am on his side—I feel powerful, above and part of nature at the same time. I envision a looming dark sky and brewing magic. There is a recognizable thrill associated with the prospect of what will happen next.","I am confused by the last sentence—I feel like I need more context to understand it, whereas the rest of the story feels like a valid comprehensible excerpt.
